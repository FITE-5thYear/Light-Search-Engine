==Chapter XVII==

&quot;Tired?&quot;

Jacob Welse put both hands on Frona's shoulders, and his eyes spoke the
love his stiff tongue could not compass.  The tree and the excitement
and the pleasure were over with, a score or so of children had gone
home frostily happy across the snow, the last guest had departed, and
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day were blending into one.

She returned his fondness with glad-eyed interest, and they dropped
into huge comfortable chairs on either side the fireplace, in which the
back-log was falling to ruddy ruin.

&quot;And this time next year?&quot;  He put the question seemingly to the
glowing log, and, as if in ominous foreshadow, it flared brightly and
crumbled away in a burst of sparks.

&quot;It is marvellous,&quot; he went on, dismissing the future in an effort to
shake himself into a wholesomer frame of mind.  &quot;It has been one long
continuous miracle, the last few months, since you have been with me.
We have seen very little of each other, you know, since your childhood,
and when I think upon it soberly it is hard to realize that you are
really mine, sprung from me, bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh.  As
the tangle-haired wild young creature of Dyea,--a healthy, little,
natural animal and nothing more,--it required no imagination to accept
you as one of the breed of Welse.  But as Frona, the woman, as you were
to-night, as you are now as I look at you, as you have been since you
came down the Yukon, it is hard . . .  I cannot realize . . .  I . . .&quot;
He faltered and threw up his hands helplessly.  &quot;I almost wish that I
had given you no education, that I had kept you with me, faring with
me, adventuring with me, achieving with me, and failing with me.  I
would have known you, now, as we sit by the fire.  As it is, I do not.
To that which I did know there has been added, somehow (what shall I
call it?), a subtlety; complexity,--favorite words of yours,--which is
beyond me.

&quot;No.&quot;  He waved the speech abruptly from her lips.  She came over and
knelt at his feet, resting her head on his knee and clasping his hand
in firm sympathy.  &quot;No, that is not true.  Those are not the words.  I
cannot find them.  I fail to say what I feel.  Let me try again.
Underneath all you do carry the stamp of the breed.  I knew I risked
the loss of that when I sent you away, but I had faith in the
persistence of the blood and I took the chance; doubted and feared when
you were gone; waited and prayed dumbly, and hoped oftentimes
hopelessly; and then the day dawned, the day of days!  When they said
your boat was coming, death rose and walked on the one hand of me, and
on the other life everlasting.  &lt;i&gt;Made or marred; made or marred&lt;/i&gt;,--the
words rang through my brain till they maddened me.  Would the Welse
remain the Welse?  Would the blood persist?  Would the young shoot rise
straight and tall and strong, green with sap and fresh and vigorous?
Or would it droop limp and lifeless, withered by the heats of the world
other than the little simple, natural Dyea world?

&quot;It was the day of days, and yet it was a lingering, watching, waiting
tragedy.  You know I had lived the years lonely, fought the lone fight,
and you, away, the only kin.  If it had failed . . .  But your boat
shot from the bluffs into the open, and I was half-afraid to look.  Men
have never called me coward, but I was nearer the coward then than ever
and all before.  Ay, that moment I had faced death easier.  And it was
foolish, absurd.  How could I know whether it was for good or ill when
you drifted a distant speck on the river?  Still, I looked, and the
miracle began, for I did know.  You stood at the steering-sweep.  You
were a Welse.  It seems so little; in truth it meant so much.  It was
not to be expected of a mere woman, but of a Welse, yes.  And when
Bishop went over the side, and you gripped the situation as
imperatively as the sweep, and your voice rang out, and the Siwashes
bent their backs to your will,--then was it the day of days.&quot;

&quot;I tried always, and remembered,&quot; Frona whispered.  She crept up softly
till her arm was about his neck and her head against his breast.  He
rested one arm lightly on her body, and poured her bright hair again
and again from his hand in glistening waves.

&quot;As I said, the stamp of the breed was unmarred, but there was yet a
difference.  There is a difference.  I have watched it, studied it,
tried to make it out.  I have sat at table, proud by the side of you,
but dwarfed.  When you talked of little things I was large enough to
follow; when of big things, too small.  I knew you, had my hand on you,
when &lt;i&gt;presto&lt;/i&gt;! and you were away, gone--I was lost.  He is a fool who
knows not his own ignorance; I was wise enough to know mine.  Art,
poetry, music,--what do I know of them?  And they were the great
things, are the great things to you, mean more to you than the little
things I may comprehend.  And I had hoped, blindly, foolishly, that we
might be one in the spirit as well as the one flesh.  It has been
bitter, but I have faced it, and understand.  But to see my own red
blood get away from me, elude me, rise above me!  It stuns.  God!  I
have heard you read from your Browning--no, no; do not speak--and
watched the play of your face, the uplift and the passion of it, and
all the while the words droning in upon me, meaningless, musical,
maddening.  And Mrs. Schoville sitting there, nursing an expression of
idiotic ecstasy, and understanding no more than I.  I could have
strangled her.

&quot;Why, I have stolen away, at night, with your Browning, and locked
myself in like a thief in fear.  The text was senseless, I have beaten
my head with my fist like a wild man, to try and knock some
comprehension into it.  For my life had worked itself out along one set
groove, deep and narrow.  I was in the rut.  I had done those things
which came to my hand and done them well; but the time was past; I
could not turn my hand anew.  I, who am strong and dominant, who have
played large with destiny, who could buy body and soul a thousand
painters and versifiers, was baffled by a few paltry cents' worth of
printed paper!&quot;

He spilled her hair for a moment's silence.

&quot;To come back.  I had attempted the impossible, gambled against the
inevitable.  I had sent you from me to get that which I had not,
dreaming that we would still be one.  As though two could be added to
two and still remain two.  So, to sum up, the breed still holds, but
you have learned an alien tongue.  When you speak it I am deaf.  And
bitterest of all, I know that the new tongue is the greater.  I do not
know why I have said all this, made my confession of weakness--&quot;

&quot;Oh, father mine, greatest of men!&quot; She raised her head and laughed
into his eyes, the while brushing back the thick iron-gray hair which
thatched the dome of his forehead.  &quot;You, who have wrestled more
mightily, done greater things than these painters and versifiers.  You
who know so well the law of change.  Might not the same plaint fall
from your father's lips were he to sit now beside you and look upon
your work and you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes.  I have said that I understand.  Do not let us discuss
it . . .  a moment's weakness.  My father was a great man.&quot;

&quot;And so mine.&quot;

&quot;A struggler to the end of his days.  He fought the great lone
fight--&quot;

&quot;And so mine.&quot;

&quot;And died fighting.&quot;

&quot;And so shall mine.  So shall we all, we Welses.&quot;

He shook her playfully, in token of returning spirits.  &quot;But I intend
to sell out,--mines, Company, everything,--and study Browning.&quot;

&quot;Still the fight.  You can't discount the blood, father.&quot;

&quot;Why were you not a boy?&quot; he demanded, abruptly.  &quot;You would have been
a splendid one.  As it is, a woman, made to be the delight of some man,
you must pass from me--to-morrow, next day, this time next year, who
knows how soon?  Ah? now I know the direction my thought has been
trending.  Just as I know you do, so do I recognize the inevitableness
of it and the justness.  But the man, Frona, the man?&quot;

&quot;Don't,&quot; she demurred.  &quot;Tell me of your father's fight, the last
fight, the great lone fight at Treasure City.  Ten to one it was, and
well fought.  Tell me.&quot;

&quot;No, Frona.  Do you realize that for the first time in our lives we
talk together seriously, as father and daughter,--for the first time?
You have had no mother to advise; no father, for I trusted the blood,
and wisely, and let you go.  But there comes a time when the mother's
counsel is needed, and you, you who never knew one?&quot;

Frona yielded, in instant recognition, and waiting, snuggled more
closely to him.

&quot;This man, St. Vincent--how is it between you?&quot;

&quot;I . . .  I do not know.  How do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Remember always, Frona, that you have free choice, yours is the last
word.  Still, I would like to understand.  I could . . .  perhaps . . .
I might be able to suggest.  But nothing more.  Still, a suggestion . . .&quot;

There was something inexpressibly sacred about it, yet she found
herself tongue-tied.  Instead of the one definite thing to say, a
muddle of ideas fluttered in her brain.  After all, could he
understand?  Was there not a difference which prevented him from
comprehending the motives which, for her, were impelling?  For all her
harking back to the primitive and stout defence of its sanity and
truth, did his native philosophy give him the same code which she drew
from her acquired philosophy?  Then she stood aside and regarded
herself and the queries she put, and drew apart from them, for they
breathed of treason.

&quot;There is nothing between us, father,&quot; she spoke up resolutely.  &quot;Mr.
St. Vincent has said nothing, nothing.  We are good friends, we like
each other, we are very good friends.  I think that is all.&quot;

&quot;But you like each other; you like him.  Is it in the way a woman must
like a man before she can honestly share her life with him, lose
herself in him?  Do you feel with Ruth, so that when the time comes you
can say, 'Thy people are my people, and thy God my God'?&quot;

&quot;N---o.  It may be; but I cannot, dare not face it, say it or not say
it, think it or not think it--now.  It is the great affirmation.  When
it comes it must come, no one may know how or why, in a great white
flash, like a revelation, hiding nothing, revealing everything in
dazzling, blinding truth.  At least I so imagine.&quot;

Jacob Welse nodded his head with the slow meditation of one who
understands, yet stops to ponder and weigh again.

&quot;But why have you asked, father?  Why has Mr. St. Vincent been raised?
I have been friends with other men.&quot;

&quot;But I have not felt about other men as I do of St. Vincent.  We may be
truthful, you and I, and forgive the pain we give each other.  My
opinion counts for no more than another's.  Fallibility is the
commonest of curses.  Nor can I explain why I feel as I do--I oppose
much in the way you expect to when your great white flash sears your
eyes.  But, in a word, I do not like St. Vincent.&quot;

&quot;A very common judgment of him among the men,&quot; Frona interposed, driven
irresistibly to the defensive.

&quot;Such consensus of opinion only makes my position stronger,&quot; he
returned, but not disputatively.  &quot;Yet I must remember that I look upon
him as men look.  His popularity with women must proceed from the fact
that women look differently than men, just as women do differ
physically and spiritually from men.  It is deep, too deep for me to
explain.  I but follow my nature and try to be just.&quot;

&quot;But have you nothing more definite?&quot; she asked, groping for better
comprehension of his attitude.  &quot;Can you not put into some sort of
coherence some one certain thing of the things you feel?&quot;

&quot;I hardly dare.  Intuitions can rarely be expressed in terms of
thought.  But let me try.  We Welses have never known a coward.  And
where cowardice is, nothing can endure.  It is like building on sand,
or like a vile disease which rots and rots and we know not when it may
break forth.&quot;

&quot;But it seems to me that Mr. St. Vincent is the last man in the world
with whom cowardice may be associated.  I cannot conceive of him in
that light.&quot;

The distress in her face hurt him.  &quot;I know nothing against St.
Vincent.  There is no evidence to show that he is anything but what he
appears.  Still, I cannot help feeling it, in my fallible human way.
Yet there is one thing I have heard, a sordid pot-house brawl in the
Opera House.  Mind you, Frona, I say nothing against the brawl or the
place,--men are men, but it is said that he did not act as a man ought
that night.&quot;

&quot;But as you say, father, men are men.  We would like to have them other
than they are, for the world surely would be better; but we must take
them as they are.  Lucile--&quot;

&quot;No, no; you misunderstand.  I did not refer to her, but to the fight.
He did not . . .  he was cowardly.&quot;

&quot;But as you say, it is &lt;i&gt;said&lt;/i&gt;.  He told me about it, not long
afterwards, and I do not think he would have dared had there been
anything--&quot;

&quot;But I do not make it as a charge,&quot; Jacob Welse hastily broke in.
&quot;Merely hearsay, and the prejudice of the men would be sufficient to
account for the tale.  And it has no bearing, anyway.  I should not
have brought it up, for I have known good men funk in my time--buck
fever, as it were.  And now let us dismiss it all from our minds.  I
merely wished to suggest, and I suppose I have bungled.  But understand
this, Frona,&quot; turning her face up to his, &quot;understand above all things
and in spite of them, first, last, and always, that you are my
daughter, and that I believe your life is sacredly yours, not mine,
yours to deal with and to make or mar.  Your life is yours to live, and
in so far that I influence it you will not have lived your life, nor
would your life have been yours.  Nor would you have been a Welse, for
there was never a Welse yet who suffered dictation.  They died first,
or went away to pioneer on the edge of things.

&quot;Why, if you thought the dance house the proper or natural medium for
self-expression, I might be sad, but to-morrow I would sanction your
going down to the Opera House.  It would be unwise to stop you, and,
further, it is not our way.  The Welses have ever stood by, in many a
lost cause and forlorn hope, knee to knee and shoulder to shoulder.
Conventions are worthless for such as we.  They are for the swine who
without them would wallow deeper.  The weak must obey or be crushed;
not so with the strong.  The mass is nothing; the individual
everything; and it is the individual, always, that rules the mass and
gives the law.  A fig for what the world says!  If the Welse should
procreate a bastard line this day, it would be the way of the Welse,
and you would be a daughter of the Welse, and in the face of hell and
heaven, of God himself, we would stand together, we of the one blood,
Frona, you and I.&quot;

&quot;You are larger than I,&quot; she whispered, kissing his forehead, and the
caress of her lips seemed to him the soft impact of a leaf falling
through the still autumn air.

And as the heat of the room ebbed away, he told of her foremother and
of his, and of the sturdy Welse who fought the great lone fight, and
died, fighting, at Treasure City.</text>

===4.4 SMF Growth and Evolution===
Following its deployment, the starting kit begins to manufacture second-generation tools, as well as replacement parts for itself. These.tools can be used to produce additional types of equipment and early product lines. Eventually, space-compatible equivalents of all major terrestrial manufacturing processes and new systems evolved in space must be available to the evolving SMF.

Further growth and increased complexity are required if the SMF is to evolve from the starting kit into a sophisticated manufacturing center which depends less and less on Earth for raw materials resupply. One key growth area especially significant in view of the heavy requirements for computers and robotics in space is the automated fabrication of integrated circuitry and other electronics components. Certain unique characteristics of the space environment, combined with anticipated advances in laser-, electron-, and ion-beam technologies, may make possible automated machinery capable of manufacturing highly sophisticated integrated circuits as well as resistors, capacitors, printed circuit boards, wire, and transformers in space, using raw materials supplied entirely from the Moon, and ultimately a wide variety of additional complex products.

====4.4.1 Starting Kits for SMF Growth====
Having considered a range of possible starting kits, the Team next explored the possibility of an ever-widening collection of production machinery using kits described in section 4.3.3. This aspect of the analysis is crucial to growth and evolution, since the taxonomy of manufacturing processes is distinct from the list of functional components comprising the implements of manufacturing. Table 4.21 showed the major functional machine components which must be available in a growing SMF. Nonterrestrial, especially lunar, materials can be used in most cases. The most serious deficiencies are the lubricants and fluids needed for pressure transfer or solution-processing (electrolytes, wetting agents), though silanes may be serviceable in lunar applications. High-powered lasers are convenient for cutting and finishing in space. The Moon is somewhat deficient in the most common gases used in tunable power lasers, He, Ar, Xe, but fortunately each gas is readily recyclable.

Manufacturing components listed in table 4.21 were reviewed specifically for derivability from starting kits, with the assumption that appropriate processed materials would be supplied as feedstock to the SMF:


*Structures - A wide variety may be produced directly from any starting kit as described in section 4.3.3. These range from very small solid pieces such as shafts or dies to much larger components including rigid members for heavy presses. Metals, ceramics, and ceramic/metal combinations can also be prepared.
*Refractories and dies - can be manufactured using the powder metallurgical components of the starting kit. Laser trimming can be performed as required after solidification and inspection of the part. These components then become available for casting complex shapes and for extruding both long-dimension components and parts designed to sustain very high temperatures and pressures.
*Heating - by direct solar energy may initially be accomplished using aluminum deposited on spherical surfaces. These surfaces may be shaped by rotation of unitary structures of appropriate radii of curvature extruded using the starting kit. Alternatively, metal vapor deposition on interior subsections of bubbles grown in zero-g may be used. The existence of solar-electric devices is assumed.
*Insulation - for both thermal and electrical needs can be derived from fiberglass mattes produced by a spinning process involving the extrusion of molten glass through small orifices. Electrical insulation exhibiting mechanical softness or compliance is achieved by pressing fiber mattes into long thin ribbons and then wrapping these tightly around the wires, followed by partial sintering. Basalt fibers may be useful in this application (see section 4.2.2).
*Magnetic materials - can be manufactured directly from the starting kits or by powder metallurgical technologies. Dies and heating equipment produced in earlier steps are probably required for maximum versatility.
*Electrical conductors - particularly wires for motors, busbars and other purposes, may be extruded (original starting kit equipment) or fabricated using rollers and dies derived from structure and refractory manufacturing components produced earlier.
*Grinders - are needed for precision finishing of surfaces. These tools should be producible by pressing and casting operations available with the starting kits. Grinders may be composed of spinel grains (a lunar-abundant grinding agent) embedded in glass fiber mattes perfused with calcium for mechanical softness and binding.
*Glasses and fibers - can be manufactured by using casting, grinding, and die-extrusion operations. Grinding is required for optical-quality glass shapes. Electron-beam and laser techniques are useful for final finishing of optical surfaces.
*Adhesives and coatings - of metals and ceramics can be applied by the starting kits or a specialized kit suited to the particular geometries of certain parts.
*Lubricants and fluids - present special problems because of deficiencies in presently known lunar raw materials resources. It may be that self-lubricating powder metallurgy bearings containing brass and lead in very small quantities are feasible. Also, silicon-based compounds requiring a minimum of relatively rare lunar carbon and hydrogen should be extensively investigated.
*Lasing media - It is also important to determine to what extent lasing media for high-power lasers can be derived primarily from lunar materials. Undoubtedly a considerable literature applicable to such devices already exists, but is classified for military reasons.

Control systems and electronics (see section 4.4.3) are also necessary, especially for automated manufacturing facilities in space.

Several technologies with limited terrestrial applications may prove extremely useful in space. One example is containerless production, in which objects are formed directly from melts. Overall shape is controlled by surface tension, external forces, and directed solar heating. Vapor deposition is another potentially favorable technique which should be given high research priority. Also, as the human presence in space expands, special production environments that allow the use of gases and liquids will become more commonplace. Thus chip-producing machinery, foaming and other processes requiring the recovery of production fluids may eventually become feasible in space.

It is easy to see how a starting kit might generate production equipment required for other space-compatible manufacturing techniques. (Shearing operations are assumed to be within the capabilities of starting kit laser beam units). For example, laser techniques for scribing reverse threads onto hardened steel rolling dies is a foreseeable technology (fig. 4.17). The availability of chromium on the Moon (0.6% by weight and higher in beneficiated iron grains) and lunar basalt for base plates makes thread rolling a valuable adjunct to the starting kit extrusion system.

[[Image:aasm-fig4-17.gif|frame|none|Figure 4.17.- Schematic of the principle of thread rolling.]]

A second example is magnetic-pulse-forming equipment. The two main components of the magnetic-pulse former are the forming coil and the capacitor. Robots with appropriate wrist actions should be capable of conventional winding operations to manufacture forming coils from extruded wire. The capacitor may consist of a basalt/aluminum or alumina/aluminum sandwich based on the standard formula C = kEA/d, where C is capacitance, k is the dielectric constant of basalt or alumina (4.5-8.4 at 10&lt;SUP&gt;6&lt;/SUP&gt; Hz), E is the permittivity of free space, A is capacitor plate area, and d is plate spacing.

A third example is electroforming technology. As discussed in section 4.3.1, the components of an electroforming unit are somewhat more complex than those of magnetic-pulse formers because of the need for an electrolytic plating solution. The tank containing the solution may be fabricated using the extruder, then welded together by a laser beam unit. The mandrel (fig. 4.13) may be formed of cast or sintered basalt over which aluminum is vapor-deposited. Iron or titanium anode plates are no problem for the starting kit extruder, and centrifugally spun basalt may be used in the electrolyte filter. Cast basalt pipes, an off-the-shelf terrestrial casting technology, provide necessary plumbing for the entire electroforming system.

====4.4.2 Near-Term Manufacturing Demonstration: Shuttle Tank Utilization====
The Space Shuttle external tank (Martin Marietta Corporation, 1974) carries liquid fuel for the Shuttle main engines and separates from the spacecraft just prior to orbital insertion at an altitude of about 128 km. The cylinder then follows a ballistic re-entry path, crashing into the ocean far from inhabited areas. The cylinder is not recovered or reused. But the tank, when dropped, has already achieved roughly 99.7% of orbital velocity. The added delta-V needed for tank orbital insertion is only 46 m/sec, about 10% of available Shuttle Orbiter thrust.

Alternatively, the tank could be orbited by burning the main engines for a slightly longer time, or with the aid of a jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) booster. The cylinder itself measures 8.4 m diam, 47 m long (a volume roughly equivalent to that of a 10-story condominium), and 33,503 kg in inert weight. Most of this mass is pure structural aluminum, though about 100 kg of outer skin insulation contains organic materials which could serve as the basis for early organic chemistry at the SMF (carbon, plastics, biological products, and so forth). A few tons of unused propellants (LOX and LH&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;) may also be present, and surplus materials from Shuttle operations (hydrazine, helium, food, etc.) could be stored in orbit for later use.

Any Shuttle flight carrying a volume-limited cargo can bring the external tank to orbit with near-zero propulsion costs. Valued as payload at about $1000/kg, an empty tank is worth about $33.5 million, less additional propulsion costs but plus added value derived from conversion of tank mass to useful products by the SMF. If Shuttle flies every 2 weeks, the payload value of the tank masses inserted into orbit would be the equivalent of roughly $1 billion per year. To an orbital space manufacturing economy this represents new additional income, in this case the equivalent of about 20% of the current annual NASA budget.

For such a cost-effective program to be implemented, the means for orbital insertion of the tank must first be perfected: Next, a system (teleoperated or robotic) should be designed which is capable of scraping off valuable external insulation. Cutoff valves must be added to prevent excess propellant from venting (permitting it to be stored in orbit rather than lost to space).

The starting kit provides a means of reducing the tank to powder or liquid form. The kits described earlier can accomplish this directly without the necessity of manufacturing additional process equipment. Another possibility is a solar-powered milling device (with portable atmosphere) which clamps onto the external tank and carves it into small pieces, most likely under teleoperator control. Tank fragments are then melted by a solar furnace consisting of a spherical mirror constructed by aluminizing a thermoplastic bubble hemisphere (Moore, 1980). The plastic allows sunlight to enter but retains infrared radiation by internal reflection, keeping the work materials hot. A hatch is cut in the mirror to permit insertion of metal shards, which join the growing droplet of molten aluminum at the focus. The melt volume of an entire tank would be about 12 m&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;, easily maneuverable through a small opening if processing proceeds in a dozen or so smaller batches.

Once tank material is molten a variety of manufacturing options become available. Ingots or simple bulk castings could be prepared as feedstock for other SMF processing operations. Liquid or vapor metal streams could be directed into molds or sprayed onto lighter structures for stiffening. For instance, thin thermoplastic bubbles may be aluminized to make pressure vessels, mirrors, or heavy solar sails; then plastic is stripped off and recycled. A more elegant method is to blow uniform metal bubbles directly, an ideal zero-g application. Aluminum is a good thermal conductor and reflector, and hence radiates heat slowly while retaining an even temperature distribution. Small tin bubbles have recently been blown experimentally in drop towers (Wang and Kendall, 1980), but far more research remains to be done.

Quite large volumes can be enclosed by structures manufactured using metal derived from a single Shuttle external tank. Aluminum pressure vessels 50 mils thick can retain one-third normal Earth atmosphere (O'Neill, 1977). Average tank thickness is about 250 mils, so a pressure vessel of roughly 13,000 m&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt; can be made from just one tank. This is more than fifty times the volume of the Space Shuttle cargo bay (240 m&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;).

====4.4.3 Middle-Term SMF Expansion: Manufacture of Electronics Components====
The present study urges a dramatic increase in the utilization of computerization and automation in nearly every conceivable future NASA mission. It is likely that a nonterrestrial source of computers and robots eventually will prove both useful and cost-effective in space. The team analyzed currently available and anticipated electronics components manufacturing technologies to determine which will satisfy two major criteria: (1) compatibility with a low- or zero-g factory environment, and (2) possibility of deriving required consumables from lunar resources.

Key components in computer systems include integrated circuits (ICs), capacitors, resistors, printed circuit (PC) boards, and wire. Fabrication capability in these five critical areas will permit most other necessary components to be produced as well. For instance, an IC fabrication facility could manufacture at least some varieties of transistors, diodes (rectifiers, small-signal, and zener), varactors, thyristors, silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs), and others. It would, however, have difficulty producing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) due to the scarcity of gallium and arsenic on the Moon. Thus, the intent of the following analysis is to present feasibility arguments concerning how lunar materials near-closure might generally be achieved. Substitution and comprehensive manufacture of electronics components are beyond the scope of the present study. Even with this limited review, it is encouraging to note the number of instances in which space equals or is superior to terrestrial factory environments for the manufacture of electronic components.

Integrated circuits. Conventional wafer fabrication techniques (Oldham, 1977) are, for the most part, not feasible in a lunar-supplied SMF. On the other hand, the vacuum of space greatly enhances the applicability of several techniques which are at or beyond the current terrestrial state-of-the-art.

Silicon (chemical refining required) is plentiful on the lunar surface, about 20% by weight (Phinney et at, 1977). While it is not clear precisely how lunar silicon will be transformed into boules of the pure element, it is reasonable to assume that this can be accomplished. Hard vacuum should facilitate the processes of crystal-pulling and zone-refining purification of elemental silicon (Grossman, 1976). Conventional zone refining requires induction heating (Grossman, 1976; Manasse, 1977), a space-compatible technique.

High-speed ICs using silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) technology are currently being fabricated by Hewlett-Packard (Pighini, personal communication, 1980) and others for custom applications. Should it appear desirable to produce such high-speed devices in the SMF, it is worth noting that spinel is plentiful on the Moon. Spinels are closely related to sapphire and actually provide a better crystallographic match to silicon, leading to higher mobility and less aluminum autodoping than in conventional SOS processing (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977). (The only major problem with spinel is the difficulty of finding high-quality crystals of correct composition.) Epitaxial growth of silicon on spinel substrates may be accomplished by the pyrolysis of silane (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977) according to:
&lt;TABLE&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
	&lt;TD&gt;SiH&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt; (gas)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=center&gt;-----&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Si(solid)+ 2H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; (gas).&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
	&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=center&gt;(1300 K)&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
Hydrogen is in short supply on the Moon, roughly 0.01% by weight (Phinney et al., 1977), but fortunately only small amounts of it are required in this procedure. Silane is also an intermediate product in the chemical refining scenario described by Waldron et al. (1979).

Conventional photolithography and diffusion techniques are not feasible for space electronics fabrication. Many of the required chemical elements are present in lunar soil only at the ppm or ppb level. Photoresists consist largely of hydrocarbons, substances whose atoms are rare and which deteriorate rapidly in the space environment. The best alternatives may be laser, electron beam, and ion beam technologies. It is anticipated that these methods could lead to greater reliability on an increasingly miniaturized scale, particularly under the high-quality vacuum conditions characteristic of space (Carter and Grant, 1976).

Ion implantation already has begun to supplant diffusion techniques in the practices of many semiconductor firms. This technology allows greater control over quantities of impurities introduced, depths and widths of doped volumes, concentration gradients, etc. Of particular interest for a future wafer fabrication plant in space is the potential for computer-controlled, maskless, multilayer implantation of multiple device types with submicron geometries (Namba, 1975; Wilson and Brewer, 1973). While further research and development must be conducted to translate this tremendous potential into practical reality, other features of ion implantation make it a highly desirable interim choice. Masking may be accomplished by aluminum or other metals, passivation layers, resists, etc. Doping also is possible using passivation layers, an approach which could lead to reduced leakage and better yields (Wilson and Brewer, 1973).

One drawback to ion implantation is crystal lattice damage. A recently developed technique permits extremely localized annealing by laser beam (Tebo, 1979). This process, unlike its thermal annealing predecessor, completely restores damaged crystalline structures through epitaxial regrowth. The net result is a lower resistivity material more suitable for semiconductor use, with fewer defects and higher yields. If this laser technique can be computer controlled like the multilayer ion process described earlier, automated production of three-dimensional integrated circuitry in space is entirely conceivable.

Pre-3D wafer technologies adaptable to more conventional production sequences also are available. Chemical and plasma etching processes require chemicals (e.g., HF, H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;SO&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;, CF&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;-O&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;) which cannot conveniently be supplied in sizable quantities from lunar soil. A feasible substitute may be ion beam etching. While the closely related process of sputter-etching requires high-pressure argon gas, ion-beam etching at the rate of 10-300 nm/min can be achieved in a 10&lt;SUP&gt;-4&lt;/SUP&gt; torr argon atmosphere (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977). Titanium oxide is a suitable etch mask for this process. Argon and titanium are available from lunar sources (1 ppm and 1-5%, respectively) in the necessary quantities.

One chemical vapor deposition technique is perfectly space-compatible, An electron beam easily evaporates materials such as aluminum in vacuo, so metal masking and metallization pose no unusual problems. Oxidation of silicon for masking or passivation purposes probably is most easily achieved thermally using anhydrous oxygen gas, rather than chemical vapor deposition methods which require hydrogen compounds. An alternative oxidation process might involve the use of a laser to create extremely localized heating (Tebo, 1979). Aluminum and oxygen are plentiful in lunar soil (5-14% and 40-45% by weight, respectively).

One final critical issue is cleanliness. Particulates should pose fewer problems in space than on Earth because of the absence of atmosphere for convective transfer. An aperture in the fabrication facility enclosure opposite the SMF velocity vector, suitably baffled, should provide a clean vacuum source. Some versions of such orbital devices are called molecular shields, and can provide less than 10&lt;SUP&gt;-4&lt;/SUP&gt; torr environments at LEO. Internally, moving parts and outgassing are probable sources of particulates which must be minimized (Naumann, personal communication, 1980). Condensibles may prove a bigger cleanliness problem than particles. Techniques for coping with them include avoiding line-of-sight exposure to sources, use of materials with high vapor pressures, and installation of cold traps.

Capacitors. Basic elements of discrete fixed capacitors include metal plates or foil, dielectric material, and wire leads. The plates or foil and leads can be contrived from readily available aluminum. Alumina, silica, and a variety of glass and ceramic materials provide suitable dielectrics. All of these substances are readily available from lunar sources.

Two capacitor fabrication techniques - thin- and thick-film - are compatible with silicon integrated circuit technology, though discrete capacitors generally are preferred over thick-film versions (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977). Thin-film capacitors usually are made with tantalum (Ankrum, 1971; Grossman, 1976; Khambata, 1963). However, thin-film capacitors with higher working voltages but lower capacitance and slightly poorer temperature stability can be constructed of alternating aluminum and alumina (or silica) layers over silicon dioxide and the silicon substrate (Ankrum, 1971; Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977; Khambata, 1963). Titanium dioxide is another possible dielectric - its dielectric constant is four times that of alumina (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977). Maximum capacitance values obtainable using thin-film technology are on the order of thousands of picofarads, and automated laser trimming can produce a high-accuracy (+/-0.05%) product (Grossman, 1976).

Resistors. Since carbon is a relatively scarce lunar resource, only wire-wound, metal or metal-oxide-film, and semiconductor resistors (Dummer, 1970; Claser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977) will be seriously considered for use in space applications.

Wire-wound devices are appropriate in applications requiring relatively high power dissipation, such as bleeder resistors in power supplies. Nichrome wire (80% nickel, 20% chromium) can probably be supplied in limited quantities from lunar materials (abundances 0.01-0.03% and 0.1-0.4%, respectively). Titanium, another possibility, is abundant on the Moon, and has a resistivity (42 M ohm-cm) which is approximately half that of nichrome.

However, most resistors used in computer circuitry need not dissipate much power. Thin-film and semiconductor devices appear most promising in this regard. Thin-film resistors are fabricated by evaporation or by sputtering 0.025-2.5 um of metal or metal alloy onto a substrate of alumina or silica (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977; Grossman, 1976; Khambata, 1963; Manasse, 1977). While some metallic materials commonly used in resistor manufacture are too rare in lunar soil for serious consideration (e.g., tantalum, nichrome, tin oxide, chromium), titanium offers a sheet resistance of 2 k-ohms/cm2 and a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of -100 ppm/°C (Ankrum, 1971; Dummer, 1970; Grossman, 1976; Khambata, 1963). Thus, the electron-beam evaporation and laser-beam trimming technologies discussed above may be utilized to prepare fine-tolerance, thin-film titanium resistors (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977; Grossman, 1976; Khambata, 1963; Manasse, 1977). At present it is unknown how closely these technologies can approach contemporary terrestrial tolerance and manufacturing standards (better than +/-0.005%, TCR = 1 ppm/°C; Rothschild et al., 1980).

Semiconductor resistors can be made with a technology already discussed. Ion implantation of boron into silicon produces sheet resistances of up to 12 k-ohms/cm&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;,suggesting that high discrete values are readily achievable. While less precise than their thin-film counterparts, ion-implanted semiconductor resistors have been shown to offer yields on the order of 90% after packaging (Wilson and Brewer, 1973).

Printed circuit boards. Printed circuit (PC) boards are made of phenolic resin reinforced with paper, or an epoxide resin reinforced with paper or fiberglass cloth, which is then clad with copper (Coombs, 1979; Scarlett, 1970). Unfortunately, resins deteriorate in space and are difficult to prepare from lunar resources; also, copper is rare on the Moon (8 to 31 ppm by weight; Phinney et al, 1977). A new approach to PC board manufacture is necessary. Two possibilities are basalt rock slabs and silane-coated basalt fibers (Green, personal communication, 1980). Basalt is an excellent insulator and can be drilled and aluminized to form an etchable conductive surface (Green, personal communication, 1980; Naumann, personal communication, 1980). Boards made of silane-coated basalt fibers would be lighter and easier to drill, but it is unknown whether aluminum can be vapor deposited onto such a surface. If evaporation problems should arise, a thin layer of titanium could serve as an excellent deposition primer (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977). Ion beam etching might be used selectively to remove aluminum to form any desired circuit pattern. This process is likely to be amenable to precision computer control.

Wiring. The lunar availability of aluminum will permit its widespread use as a conductor for PC board claddings and for all space wiring in general. Its low resistivity (2.8 uohm-cm) compares favorably with that of copper (1.8 uohm-cm), and it readily forms a protective anodic oxide upon exposure to air (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977). The major terrestrial drawback to aluminum conductors is their incompatibility with conventional soldering and welding methods (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977). Fortunately, the preferred welding techniques for use in space (see section 4.3.1) should bond this metal nicely. Basalt or glass fibers are possible materials for sheathing aluminum wire (Green, personal communication, 1980), and Miller and Smith (1979) have devised a space-qualified wire insulation wrapping machine.

Before leaving the topic of aluminum wire, it should be noted that high-quality inductors also may be made of this material. One class of inductors - transformers - represents a particularly important component of many computer systems. Iron is plentiful on the Moon (4-15% by weight; Phinney et al., 1977) so transformer cores present no serious problems for the proposed electronics components fabrication facility.

====4.4.4 Complex products====
The ultimate goals of the SMF are independence from terrestrial resupply, in situ production of all components needed to maintain and expand existing space facilities, and the manufacture of high-value products for consumption on Earth (fig. 4.18). Following deployment of the initial starting kit and manufacture of second-generation tools, development of a product line of ever-greater complexity must occur if the ultimate goals are to be attained. The evolution of complex product manufacturing is outlined below with a focus on just a few important potential products typical of each stage of increasing production sophistication .

[[Image:aasm-fig4-18.gif|frame|none|Figure 4.18.- An advanced Space Manufacturing Facility (SMF).]]

Platforms. Expansion of the SMF requires a concomitant enlargement of the facility platform. Such construction represents an early evolutionary threshold, a step requiring little materials processing innovation with some advancement in robotics capability. Component parts may be manufactured from cast or sintered basalt or from aluminum beams, any of which could be produced by the initial starting kit and second-generation tools embodying a synthesis of advancements which already have occurred in industrial automation and mobile autonomous robotics (Leonard, 1980; Lovelace, personal communication, 1980). Robot mobility studies by the Vought Corporation for Marshall Space Flight Center indicate that construction of space platforms is within the grasp of state-of-the-art automation technology. For instance, robot-compatible fasteners have been developed (Borrego, 1977) and deployed in simulation studies at Langley Research Center (Lovelace, 1980).

Pure glasses and synthetic crystals. The manufacture of complex products containing sophisticated electronic specialized materials may require the preparation of pure glasses and synthetic crystals. Production steps that need to be developed include material separation and sophisticated materials processing.

Consider, for example, the manufacture of synthetic quartz semiconductor materials. Plagioclase first is separated from lunar soil by electrophoresis or other techniques. The refined mineral is then fused and its chemical composition altered to induce quartz to crystallize from the cooling solution. Successful fractionation of quartz from an altered plagioclase melt requires significant advances in the techniques of controlled nucleation, crystallization, and zone refining. Development of a special materials-production capability will permit the manufacture of space-made solar panels, solid-state lasing crystals, fiber optics, and perhaps solar sails. New terrestrial materials techniques such as quick-freezing of molten metals to make &quot;glassy metals&quot; (Giuse and Guida, 1980) may find extensive use in space or on Earth.

Satellites. In-space production of satellite; will require the manufacture of special components for control, observation, and communication, and a significant evolutionary advance in automation technology. Satellites may represent the first highly complicated, coordinated construction challenge to be undertaken entirely by teleoperators or robots in space. The construction of solar-power panels, antennas, and sophisticated computer control and communications modules demands a versatile new manipulator system. This system should be equally adaptable to the high-resolution construction tasks necessary in computer assembly and the lower-resolution, high-spatial-range construction jobs required for the assembly of hulls, antennas, and solar panels. Current capabilities of automated assembly are not yet sufficiently well-developed to enable construction of a complete satellite from its constituent parts (Holland et al., 1979; Leonard, 1980; OAST, 1980; Vought Corporation, 1980).

Robots and teleoperators. Two of the most important advanced products to be manufactured in space are robots and teleoperator mechanisms. The ultimate goals for SMF cannot be attained without a significant expansion of the automation equipment initially deployed from Earth. Space robots and teleoperators eventually must be designed from working experience following initial deployment of the starting kit, and then manufactured in space. These second- and third-generation devices must be far more versatile and fault-tolerant than present-day machines. Logistics requirements for production of equipment of this complexity are staggering. The design must incorporate new features based on earlier experiences with robots and teleoperators in space facilities, and should include either a high degree of self-preservation &quot;instinct&quot; or else a highly adaptive servofeedback system using extensive space computer facilities as decisionmakers.

The manufacture of robots and teleoperators in space necessitates the automated production of intricate component parts, a task of far greater complexity than current automated assembly systems can handle (Hart, personal communication, 1980). Automated assembly of advanced devices is perhaps no more difficult than the automated assembly of satellites, which already will have been accomplished during an earlier phase of SMF evolution. The most crucial technologies to be developed for the manufacture of second- and third-generation robots and teleoperators are space-adaptive sensors and computer vision. The current state of machine tactile and vision sensor research is insufficient for sophisticated space robots and automated assembly operations (Holland et al., 1979). The best computer-vision package currently available, CONSIGHT-I, can determine the position and orientation of a wide variety of parts with preprogrammed specifications (Holland et at, 1979). Enhanced decisionmaking and self-preservation features must be added to computer-vision systems such as CONSIGHT-I for use in space robots and teleoperators. A dedicated computer for teleoperator control, programmed to make decisions based on previous experience and insight, would be an instrumental achievement requiring levels of heurism and hypothesis formation unavailable in present-day software (Sacerdoti, 1979).

Solar sails. The solar sails briefly mentioned in section 4.3.1 constitute an unusual but provocative complex product which might be manufactured at the SMF. Sails with a design capability of delivering about two 200-ton payloads per year to the heliocentric distance of Mars have been proposed (Drexler, 1980). Assuming that the viability of self-replicating factories has been demonstrated on the Moon by this point in time (see chapter 5), an interesting scenario would involve the transport of 100-ton self-reproducing &quot;seed&quot; machines (Freitas, 1980c; Freitas and Zachary, 1981) from a lunar-source facility to other moons and planets in the Solar System.

Other complex products. A number of complex products representing various evolutionary steps not yet mentioned or discussed might include impulse landers, biological products, storage tanks, mobile rovers, nuclear power stations, agricultural products, and many others integral to the evolution of a complex products manufacturing capability. The time sequence of these steps is a function of the desired technologies which must be developed at one stage and integrated at a later stage to make products of ever-increasing complexity.

SMF establishment and growth requires a vigorous parallel development of the three basic materials/energy functions - raw materials and materials processing, manufacturing and technology, and energy production. As the SMF increases in output and creates new net resources, unit output costs should fall and an ever-increasing array of commercially interesting products and services will come into existence. Figure 4.19 and table 4.23 illustrate some of the higher-order systems and services which might be expected ultimately to develop.

&lt;P&gt;Automared/teleoperated lunar exploration- Orbital and highly mobile teleoperated or automated rovers will explore the lunar surface (particularly the poles) for possible alkalic basalts and volatiles. The discovery of significant volatiles, especially water, would reduce the complexity of achieving growth and independence.
&lt;P&gt;Transition to nonterrestrial raw materials- Production of aluminum, titanium, processing chemicals and many other materials will. be initiated. This will require a transport system and/or mass-driver facility This effort will begin with modest goals, later culminating in complete raw materials independence for the SMF.
&lt;P&gt;Asteroid raw material utilization- Water, carbon, platinum group metals and other materials will be returned to LEO and utilized by SMF.

&lt;div class=prose&gt;

1. ''Division of simple ideas.''
The better to conceive the ideas we receive from sensation, it may not be amiss for us to consider them, in reference to the different ways whereby they make their approaches to our minds, and make themselves perceivable by us.

First, then, There are some which come into our minds by one sense only.

Secondly, There are others that convey themselves into the mind by more senses than one.

Thirdly, Others that are had from reflection only.

Fourthly, There are some that make themselves way, and are suggested to the mind by all the ways of sensation and reflection.

We shall consider them apart under these several heads.

Ideas of one sense. There are some ideas which have admittance only through one sense, which is peculiarly adapted to receive them. Thus light and colours, as white, red, yellow, blue ; with their several degrees or shades and mixtures, as green, scarlet, purple, sea-green, and the rest, come in only by the eyes. All kinds of noises, sounds, and tones, only by the ears. The several tastes and smells, by the nose and palate. And if these organs, or the nerves which are the conduits to convey them from without to their audience in the brain, – the mind’s presence-room (as I may so call it) – are any of them so disordered as not to perform their functions, they have no postern to be admitted by ; no other way to bring themselves into view, and be perceived by the understanding.

The most considerable of those belonging to the touch, are heat and cold, and solidity : all the rest, consisting almost wholly in the sensible configuration, as smooth and rough ; or else, more or less firm adhesion of the parts, as hard and soft, tough and brittle, are obvious enough.

2. ''Few simple ideas have names.''
I think it will be needless to enumerate all the particular simple ideas belonging to each sense. Nor indeed is it possible if we would ; there being a great many more of them belonging to most of the senses than we have names for. The variety of smells, which are as many almost, if not more, than species of bodies in the world, do most of them want names. Sweet and stinking commonly serve our turn for these ideas, which in effect is little more than to call them pleasing or displeasing ; though the smell of a rose and violet, both sweet, are certainly very distinct ideas. Nor are the different tastes, that by our palates we receive ideas of, much better provided with names. Sweet, bitter, sour, harsh, and salt are almost all the epithets we have to denominate that numberless variety of relishes, which are to be found distinct, not only in almost every sort of creatures, but in the different parts of the same plant, fruit, or animal. The same may be said of colours and sounds. I shall, therefore, in the account of simple ideas I am here giving, content myself to set down only such as are most material to our present purpose, or are in themselves less apt to be taken notice of though they are very frequently the ingredients of our complex ideas ; amongst which, I think, I may well account solidity, which therefore I shall treat of in the next chapter.</text>

'''KOSCIUSZKO, Tadeusz''' ({{small-caps|Thaddeus}}) (kos-se-us'-ko),
Polish patriot, b. near Novogrudek, Lithuania,
12 Feb., 1746; d. in Solothurn, Switzerland,
&lt;!-- p. 573 --&gt;
15 Oct., 1817. He was descended from a noble
Lithuanian family, studied at the military academy
of Warsaw, and, completing his education in
France at the expense of the state, returned to
Poland, entered the army, and rose to the rank of
captain. An unrequited passion for the daughter
of the Marquis of Lithuania induced him to leave
Poland in 1775 and
offer his assistance
to the Americans in
their war for
independence. The
number of foreign
auxiliary officers
had become numerous,
and Washington
had complained
to congress, in
October, 1776, that he
was unable to
employ many of them,
owing to their
ignorance of English.
Kosciuszko,
however, arrived with
letters of
recommendation from
Benjamin Franklin
to Washington, who inquired what he could do.
&amp;ldquo;I come to fight as a volunteer for American
independence,&amp;rdquo; answered Kosciuszko. &amp;ldquo;What can
you do?&amp;rdquo; asked Washington. &amp;ldquo;Try me,&amp;rdquo; was the
reply. He received his commission as a colonel of
engineers on 18 Oct., 1776, and repaired to his
post with the troops under Gen. Gates, who
described him as &amp;ldquo;an able engineer, and one of the
best and neatest draughtsmen that he ever saw,&amp;rdquo;
and selected him for the northern service, ordering
him, &amp;ldquo;after he had made himself thoroughly
acquainted with the works, to point out where and
in what manner the best improvements and additions
could be made thereto.&amp;rdquo; Kosciuszko therefore
planned the encampment and post of Gates's
army at Bemis Heights, near Saratoga, from
which, after two well-fought actions, Burgoyne
found it impossible to dislodge the Americans.
Kosciuszko was subsequently the principal engineer
in executing the works at West Point. He
became one of Washington's adjutants, and aided
Gen. Nathanael Greene in the unsuccessful siege of
Ninety-Six, receiving for his services the thanks
of congress and the brevet of brigadier-general,
13 Oct., 1783. One of Washington's latest
official acts was to intercede with congress for the
bestowal of these honors. He was also made a
member of the Society of the Cincinnati. At the
end of the war he returned to Poland, where he
lived several years in retirement. When the Polish
army was reorganized in 1789, he was appointed a
major-general, and fought in defence of the
constitution of 3 May, 1791, under Prince Poniatowski,
against the Russians. He was in the battle of
Zielence, 18 June, 1792, and in that of Dubienka,
17 July, 1792, where, with only 4,000 men, he kept
15,000 Russians at bay for six hours, making his
retreat without great loss. But the patriots
were overwhelmed by numbers, and when King
Stanislas submitted to the second partition of
Poland, Kosciuszko resigned his commission and
retired to Leipsic, where he received from the
national assembly the citizenship of France. He
determined to make a second effort for Poland, and
a rising of his countrymen was secretly planned.
Kosciuszko was elected dictator and general-in-chief.
On 24 March, 1794, he suddenly appeared
&lt;!-- column 2 --&gt;
in Cracow, issued a manifesto against the Russians,
and hastily collected a force of about 5,000 peasants,
armed mostly with scythes. At Raclawice he
routed a Russian corps that was almost twice as
strong, and returned in triumph to Cracow. He
committed the conduct of government affairs to a
national council that was organized by himself,
and after receiving re-enforcements moved
forward in quest of the Russian army. The march
was opposed by the king of Prussia at the head of
40,000 men, and Kosciuszko, whose force was only
13,000, was defeated at Szczekociny, 6 June, 1794.
Unable to check the prevailing anarchy, Kosciuszko
resigned his dictatorship and retired with his
army to Warsaw, and defended it against the
Prussians and Russians, whom he compelled to
raise the siege. Austria now took part against
him with 150,000 men, and he was routed at
Maciejowice, 10 Oct., 1794. Kosciuszko fell covered
with wounds. He was imprisoned in St. Petersburg
for two years, until the death of Catherine,
when the Emperor Paul gave him his liberty, with
many marks of esteem. The czar, in releasing
him, offered him his sword, but Kosciuszko refused
to accept it, saying, &amp;ldquo;I have no need of a sword;
I have no country to defend.&amp;rdquo; Subsequently his
countrymen in the French army of Italy presented
him with the sword of John Sobieski. On crossing
the Russian frontier he returned to the czar the
patent of his pension and every testimonial of
Russian favor, and passed the rest of his life in retirement.
He visited the United States in 1797, where
he was received with distinction, and obtained from
congress a grant of land, in addition to the pension
that he had received after the Revolutionary
war. He then resided in Fontainebleau until 1814,
engaged in agriculture. When Napoleon was
about to invade Poland in 1806 he wished to
employ Kosciuszko, who, being under parole not to
fight against Russia, refused to enlist, and the
proclamation to the Poles that appeared in the
&amp;ldquo;Moniteur&amp;rdquo; under his name in 1806 he declared
to be a forgery. In 1816 he removed to Solothurn,
Switzerland, and in the following year sent a deed
of manumission to all the serfs on his Polish
estate. His death was caused by a fall from his
horse over a precipice. The Emperor Alexander
had him interred
beside Poniatowski and
Sobieski in the cathedral
of Cracow, near
which city the people
raised to his memory
a mound 150 feet high,
the earth of which was
brought from every
great battle-field of
Poland. From a fancied
resemblance to
this mound the loftiest
mountain in Australia
has received the
name of Mount
Kosciuszko. A monument
of white marble, designed by John H. B. Latrobe,
and represented in the illustration, was erected to
his memory at West Point by the U. S. military
academy cadet corps of 1828, at a cost of $5,000.
See Chodzko's &amp;ldquo;Histoire militaire, politique et
privée de Kosciuszko&amp;rdquo; (Paris, 1837); and
Falkenstein's &amp;ldquo;Leben Kosciuszko's&amp;rdquo; (Leipsic, 1825).

==Chapter XVI==

I found her down in the old neighborhood near the
blueberry swamp, where my mother lived and where
Lop-Ear and I had built our first tree-shelter.  It was
unexpected.  As I came under the tree I heard the
familiar soft sound and looked up.  There she was, the
Swift One, sitting on a limb and swinging her legs back
and forth as she looked at me.

I stood still for some time.  The sight of her had made
me very happy.  And then an unrest and a pain began to
creep in on this happiness.  I started to climb the
tree after her, and she retreated slowly out the limb.
Just as I reached for her, she sprang through the air
and landed in the branches of the next tree.  From amid
the rustling leaves she peeped out at me and made soft
sounds.  I leaped straight for her, and after an
exciting chase the situation was duplicated, for there
she was, making soft sounds and peeping out from the
leaves of a third tree.

It was borne in upon me that somehow it was different
now from the old days before Lop-Ear and I had gone on
our adventure-journey. I wanted her, and I knew that I
wanted her.  And she knew it, too. That was why she
would not let me come near her.  I forgot that she was
truly the Swift One, and that in the art of climbing
she had been my teacher.  I pursued her from tree to
tree, and ever she eluded me, peeping back at me with
kindly eyes, making soft sounds, and dancing and
leaping and teetering before me just out of reach.  The
more she eluded me, the more I wanted to catch her, and
the lengthening shadows of the afternoon bore witness
to the futility of my effort.

As I pursued her, or sometimes rested in an adjoining
tree and watched her, I noticed the change in her.  She
was larger, heavier, more grown-up.  Her lines were
rounder, her muscles fuller, and there was about her
that indefinite something of maturity that was new to
her and that incited me on.  Three years she had been
gone--three years at the very least, and the change in
her was marked.  I say three years; it is as near as I
can measure the time.  A fourth year may have elapsed,
which I have confused with the happenings of the other
three years.  The more I think of it, the more
confident I am that it must be four years that she was
away.

Where she went, why she went, and what happened to her
during that time, I do not know.  There was no way for
her to tell me, any more than there was a way for
Lop-Ear and me to tell the Folk what we had seen when
we were away.  Like us, the chance is she had gone off
on an adventure-journey, and by herself.  On the other
hand, it is possible that Red-Eye may have been the
cause of her going.  It is quite certain that he must
have come upon her from time to time, wandering in the
woods; and if he had pursued her there is no question
but that it would have been sufficient to drive her
away.  From subsequent events, I am led to believe that
she must have travelled far to the south, across a
range of mountains and down to the banks of a strange
river, away from any of her kind.  Many Tree People
lived down there, and I think it must have been they
who finally drove her back to the horde and to me.  My
reasons for this I shall explain later.

The shadows grew longer, and I pursued more ardently
than ever, and still I could not catch her.  She made
believe that she was trying desperately to escape me,
and all the time she managed to keep just beyond reach.
I forgot everything--time, the oncoming of night, and
my meat-eating enemies.  I was insane with love of her,
and with--anger, too, because she would not let me come
up with her.  It was strange how this anger against her
seemed to be part of my desire for her.

As I have said, I forgot everything.  In racing across
an open space I ran full tilt upon a colony of snakes.
They did not deter me.  I was mad.  They struck at me,
but I ducked and dodged and ran on.  Then there was a
python that ordinarily would have sent me screeching to
a tree-top.  He did run me into a tree; but the Swift
One was going out of sight, and I sprang back to the
ground and went on.  It was a close shave.  Then there
was my old enemy, the hyena.  From my conduct he was
sure something was going to happen, and he followed me
for an hour.  Once we exasperated a band of wild pigs,
and they took after us.  The Swift One dared a wide
leap between trees that was too much for me.  I had to
take to the ground.  There were the pigs.  I didn't
care.  I struck the earth within a yard of the nearest
one.  They flanked me as I ran, and chased me into two
different trees out of the line of my pursuit of the
Swift One.  I ventured the ground again, doubled back,
and crossed a wide open space, with the whole band
grunting, bristling, and tusk-gnashing at my heels.

If I had tripped or stumbled in that open space, there
would have been no chance for me.  But I didn't.  And I
didn't care whether I did or not.  I was in such mood
that I would have faced old Saber-Tooth himself, or a
score of arrow-shooting Fire People.  Such was the
madness of love...with me.  With the Swift One it was
different.  She was very wise.  She did not take any
real risks, and I remember, on looking back across the
centuries to that wild love-chase, that when the pigs
delayed me she did not run away very fast, but waited,
rather, for me to take up the pursuit again.  Also, she
directed her retreat before me, going always in the
direction she wanted to go.

At last came the dark.  She led me around the mossy
shoulder of a canyon wall that out-jutted among the
trees.  After that we penetrated a dense mass of
underbrush that scraped and ripped me in passing.  But
she never ruffled a hair.  She knew the way.  In the
midst of the thicket was a large oak.  I was very close
to her when she climbed it; and in the forks, in the
nest-shelter I had sought so long and vainly, I caught
her.

The hyena had taken our trail again, and he now sat
down on the ground and made hungry noises.  But we did
not mind, and we laughed at him when he snarled and
went away through the thicket. It was the spring-time,
and the night noises were many and varied. As was the
custom at that time of the year, there was much
fighting among the animals.  From the nest we could
hear the squealing and neighing of wild horses, the
trumpeting of elephants, and the roaring of lions.  But
the moon came out, and the air was warm, and we laughed
and were unafraid.

I remember, next morning, that we came upon two ruffled
cock-birds that fought so ardently that I went right up
to them and caught them by their necks.  Thus did the
Swift One and I get our wedding breakfast.  They were
delicious.  It was easy to catch birds in the spring of
the year.  There was one night that year when two elk
fought in the moonlight, while the Swift One and I
watched from the trees; and we saw a lion and lioness
crawl up to them unheeded, and kill them as they
fought.

There is no telling how long we might have lived in the
Swift One's tree-shelter.  But one day, while we were
away, the tree was struck by lightning.  Great limbs
were riven, and the nest was demolished.  I started to
rebuild, but the Swift One would have nothing to do
with it.  As I was to learn, she was greatly afraid of
lightning, and I could not persuade her back into the
tree.  So it came about, our honeymoon over, that we
went to the caves to live.  As Lop-Ear had evicted me
from the cave when he got married, I now evicted him;
and the Swift One and I settled down in it, while he
slept at night in the connecting passage of the double
cave.

And with our coming to live with the horde came
trouble.  Red-Eye had had I don't know how many wives
since the Singing One.  She had gone the way of the
rest.  At present he had a little, soft, spiritless
thing that whimpered and wept all the time, whether he
beat her or not; and her passing was a question of very
little time.  Before she passed, even, Red-Eye set his
eyes on the Swift One; and when she passed, the
persecution of the Swift One began.

Well for her that she was the Swift One, that she had
that amazing aptitude for swift flight through the
trees.  She needed all her wisdom and daring in order
to keep out of the clutches of Red-Eye. I could not
help her.  He was so powerful a monster that he could
have torn me limb from limb.  As it was, to my death I
carried an injured shoulder that ached and went lame in
rainy weather and that was a mark of is handiwork.

The Swift One was sick at the time I received this
injury.  It must have been a touch of the malaria from
which we sometimes suffered; but whatever it was, it
made her dull and heavy.  She did not have the
accustomed spring to her muscles, and was indeed in
poor shape for flight when Red-Eye cornered her near
the lair of the wild dogs, several miles south from the
caves.  Usually, she would have circled around him,
beaten him in the straight-away, and gained the
protection of our small-mouthed cave.  But she could
not circle him.  She was too dull and slow.  Each time
he headed her off, until she gave over the attempt and
devoted her energies wholly to keeping out of his
clutches.

Had she not been sick it would have been child's play
for her to elude him; but as it was, it required all
her caution and cunning. It was to her advantage that
she could travel on thinner branches than he, and make
wider leaps.  Also, she was an unerring judge of
distance, and she had an instinct for knowing the
strength of twigs, branches, and rotten limbs.

It was an interminable chase.  Round and round and back
and forth for long stretches through the forest they
dashed.  There was great excitement among the other
Folk.  They set up a wild chattering, that was loudest
when Red-Eye was at a distance, and that hushed when
the chase led him near.  They were impotent onlookers.
The females screeched and gibbered, and the males beat
their chests in helpless rage.  Big Face was especially
angry, and though he hushed his racket when Red-Eye
drew near, he did not hush it to the extent the others
did.

As for me, I played no brave part.  I know I was
anything but a hero.  Besides, of what use would it
have been for me to encounter Red-Eye? He was the
mighty monster, the abysmal brute, and there was no
hope for me in a conflict of strength.  He would have
killed me, and the situation would have remained
unchanged.  He would have caught the Swift One before
she could have gained the cave.  As it was, I could
only look on in helpless fury, and dodge out of the way
and cease my raging when he came too near.

The hours passed.  It was late afternoon.  And still
the chase went on.  Red-Eye was bent upon exhausting
the Swift One.  He deliberately ran her down.  After a
long time she began to tire and could no longer
maintain her headlong flight.  Then it was that she
began going far out on the thinnest branches, where he
could not follow.  Thus she might have got a breathing
spell, but Red-Eye was fiendish.  Unable to follow her,
he dislodged her by shaking her off.  With all his
strength and weight, he would shake the branch back and
forth until he snapped her off as one would snap a fly
from a whip-lash.  The first time, she saved herself by
falling into branches lower down.  Another time, though
they did not save her from the ground, they broke her
fall.  Still another time, so fiercely did he snap her
from the branch, she was flung clear across a gap into
another tree.  It was remarkable, the way she gripped
and saved herself.  Only when driven to it did she seek
the temporary safety of the thin branches.  But she was
so tired that she could not otherwise avoid him, and
time after time she was compelled to take to the thin
branches.

Still the chase went on, and still the Folk screeched,
beat their chests, and gnashed their teeth.  Then came
the end.  It was almost twilight.  Trembling, panting,
struggling for breath, the Swift One clung pitiably to
a high thin branch.  It was thirty feet to the ground,
and nothing intervened.  Red-Eye swung back and forth
on the branch farther down.  It became a pendulum,
swinging wider and wider with every lunge of his
weight.  Then he reversed suddenly, just before the
downward swing was completed. Her grips were torn
loose, and, screaming, she was hurled toward the
ground.

But she righted herself in mid-air and descended feet
first. Ordinarily, from such a height, the spring in
her legs would have eased the shock of impact with the
ground.  But she was exhausted. She could not exercise
this spring.  Her legs gave under her, having only
partly met the shock, and she crashed on over on her
side.  This, as it turned out, did not injure her, but
it did knock the breath from her lungs.  She lay
helpless and struggling for air.

Red-Eye rushed upon her and seized her.  With his
gnarly fingers twisted into the hair of her head, he
stood up and roared in triumph and defiance at the awed
Folk that watched from the trees. Then it was that I
went mad.  Caution was thrown to the winds; forgotten
was the will to live of my flesh.  Even as Red-Eye
roared, from behind I dashed upon him.  So unexpected
was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.  I
twined my arms and legs around him and strove to hold
him down.  This would have been impossible to
accomplish had he not held tightly with one hand to the
Swift One's hair.

Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden
ally.  He charged in, sank his teeth in Red-Eye's arm,
and ripped and tore at his face.  This was the time for
the rest of the Folk to have joined in.  It was the
chance to do for Red-Eye for all time.  But they
remained afraid in the trees.

It was inevitable that Red-Eye should win in the
struggle against the two of us.  The reason he did not
finish us off immediately was that the Swift One
clogged his movements.  She had regained her breath and
was beginning to resist.  He would not release his
clutch on her hair, and this handicapped him.  He got a
grip on my arm.  It was the beginning of the end for
me.  He began to draw me toward him into a position
where he could sink his teeth into my throat.  His
mouth was open, and he was grinning.  And yet, though
he had just begun to exert his strength, in that moment
he wrenched my shoulder so that I suffered from it for
the remainder of my life.

And in that moment something happened.  There was no
warning.  A great body smashed down upon the four of us
locked together.  We were driven violently apart and
rolled over and over, and in the suddenness of surprise
we released our holds on one another.  At the moment of
the shock, Big-Face screamed terribly.  I did not know
what had happened, though I smelled tiger and caught a
glimpse of striped fur as I sprang for a tree.

It was old Saber-Tooth.  Aroused in his lair by the
noise we had made, he had crept upon us unnoticed.  The
Swift One gained the next tree to mine, and I
immediately joined her.  I put my arms around her and
held her close to me while she whimpered and cried
softly.  From the ground came a snarling, and crunching
of bones. It was Saber-Tooth making his supper off of
what had been Big-Face.  From beyond, with inflamed
rims and eyes, Red-Eye peered down.  Here was a monster
mightier than he.  The Swift One and I turned and went
away quietly through the trees toward the cave, while
the Folk gathered overhead and showered down abuse and
twigs and branches upon their ancient enemy.  He lashed
his tail and snarled, but went on eating.

And in such fashion were we saved.  It was a mere
accident--the sheerest accident.  Else would I have
died, there in Red-Eye's clutch, and there would have
been no bridging of time to the tune of a thousand
centuries down to a progeny that reads newspapers and
rides on electric cars--ay, and that writes narratives
of bygone happenings even as this is written.</text>

==Chapter 1==
{{chapter|1}} {{verse|chapter=1|verse=1}}The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, {{verse|chapter=1|verse=2}}that Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. {{verse|chapter=1|verse=3}}They said to me, “The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.” {{verse|chapter=1|verse=4}}It happened, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven, {{verse|chapter=1|verse=5}}and said, “I beg you, Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments: {{verse|chapter=1|verse=6}}Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father’s house have sinned. {{verse|chapter=1|verse=7}}We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses.

{{verse|chapter=1|verse=8}}“Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples; {{verse|chapter=1|verse=9}}but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.’

{{verse|chapter=1|verse=10}}“Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand. {{verse|chapter=1|verse=11}}Lord, I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”

Now I was cup bearer to the king.

==Chapter 2==
{{chapter|2}} {{verse|chapter=2|verse=1}}It happened in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been ''before'' sad in his presence. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=2}}The king said to me, “Why is your face sad, seeing you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart.”

Then I was very much afraid. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=3}}I said to the king, “Let the king live forever! Why shouldn’t my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?”

{{verse|chapter=2|verse=4}}Then the king said to me, “For what do you make request?”

So I prayed to the God of heaven. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=5}}I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may build it.”

{{verse|chapter=2|verse=6}}The king said to me (the queen was also sitting by him), “For how long shall your journey be? And when will you return?”

So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=7}}Moreover I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah; {{verse|chapter=2|verse=8}}and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into.”

The king granted my requests, because of the good hand of my God on me. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=9}}Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=10}}When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=11}}So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=12}}I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any animal with me, except the animal that I rode on. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=13}}I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal’s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=14}}Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king’s pool: but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=15}}Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=16}}The rulers didn’t know where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work. {{verse|chapter=2|verse=17}}Then I said to them, “You see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we won’t be disgraced.” {{verse|chapter=2|verse=18}}I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me, as also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me.

They said, “Let’s rise up and build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work.

{{verse|chapter=2|verse=19}}But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us, and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”

{{verse|chapter=2|verse=20}}Then answered I them, and said to them, “The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, his servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.”

==Chapter 3==
{{chapter|3}} {{verse|chapter=3|verse=1}}Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up its doors; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananel. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=2}}Next to him built the men of Jericho. Next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=3}}The fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build; they laid its beams, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=4}}Next to them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. Next to them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. Next to them repaired Zadok the son of Baana. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=5}}Next to them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles didn’t put their necks to the work of their lord. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=6}}The old gate repaired Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid its beams, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its bars. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=7}}Next to them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, ''that appertained'' to the throne of the governor beyond the River. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=8}}Next to him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths. Next to him repaired Hananiah one of the perfumers, and they fortified Jerusalem even to the broad wall. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=9}}Next to them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=10}}Next to them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, over against his house. Next to him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabneiah. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=11}}Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired another portion, and the tower of the furnaces. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=12}}Next to him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=13}}The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and one thousand cubits of the wall to the dung gate. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=14}}The dung gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth Haccherem; he built it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=15}}The spring gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king’s garden, even to the stairs that go down from the city of David. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=16}}After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth Zur, to the place over against the tombs of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the house of the mighty men. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=17}}After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next to him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, for his district. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=18}}After him repaired their brothers, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of Keilah. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=19}}Next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another portion, over against the ascent to the armory at the turning ''of the wall''. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=20}}After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion, from the turning ''of the wall'' to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=21}}After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz another portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=22}}After him repaired the priests, the men of the Plain. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=23}}After them repaired Benjamin and Hasshub over against their house.

After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh ''repaired''. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=26}}(Now the Nethinim lived in Ophel, to the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that stands out.) {{verse|chapter=3|verse=27}}After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower that stands out, and to the wall of Ophel. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=28}}Above the horse gate repaired the priests, everyone over against his own house. {{verse|chapter=3|verse=29}}After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his own house.

==Chapter 4==
{{chapter|4}} {{verse|chapter=4|verse=1}}But it happened that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. {{verse|chapter=4|verse=2}}He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?” {{verse|chapter=4|verse=3}}Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, “What they are building, if a fox climbed up it, he would break down their stone wall.”

{{verse|chapter=4|verse=4}}“Hear, our God; for we are despised; and turn back their reproach on their own head, give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity; {{verse|chapter=4|verse=5}}don’t cover their iniquity, and don’t let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they have insulted the builders.”

{{verse|chapter=4|verse=6}}So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half ''the height'' of it: for the people had a mind to work. {{verse|chapter=4|verse=7}}But it happened that when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, ''and'' that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very angry; {{verse|chapter=4|verse=8}}and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein. {{verse|chapter=4|verse=9}}But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them. {{verse|chapter=4|verse=10}}Judah said, “The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.” {{verse|chapter=4|verse=11}}Our adversaries said, “They shall not know, neither see, until we come into the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.”

{{verse|chapter=4|verse=12}}It happened that when the Jews who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.” {{verse|chapter=4|verse=13}}Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set ''there'' the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. {{verse|chapter=4|verse=14}}I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them! Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”

{{verse|chapter=4|verse=15}}It happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, everyone to his work. {{verse|chapter=4|verse=16}}It happened from that time forth, that half of my servants worked in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. {{verse|chapter=4|verse=17}}They all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other held his weapon; {{verse|chapter=4|verse=18}}and the builders, everyone had his sword girded by his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was by me. {{verse|chapter=4|verse=19}}I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another. {{verse|chapter=4|verse=20}}Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally there to us. Our God will fight for us.”

{{verse|chapter=4|verse=21}}So we worked in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared. {{verse|chapter=4|verse=22}}Likewise at the same time said I to the people, “Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.” {{verse|chapter=4|verse=23}}So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes. Everyone took his weapon to the water.

==Chapter 5==
{{chapter|5}} {{verse|chapter=5|verse=1}}Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=2}}For there were that said, “We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain, that we may eat and live.” {{verse|chapter=5|verse=3}}Some also there were that said, “We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain, because of the famine.” {{verse|chapter=5|verse=4}}There were also some who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=5}}Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children. Behold, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters have been brought into bondage. Neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.”

{{verse|chapter=5|verse=6}}I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=7}}Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, “You exact usury, everyone of his brother.” I held a great assembly against them. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=8}}I said to them, “We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us?” Then they held their peace, and found never a word. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=9}}Also I said, “The thing that you do is not good. Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies? {{verse|chapter=5|verse=10}}I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. Please let us stop this usury. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=11}}Please restore to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them.”

{{verse|chapter=5|verse=12}}Then they said, “We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as you say.”

Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=13}}Also I shook out my lap, and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that doesn’t perform this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.”

All the assembly said, “Amen,” and praised Yahweh. The people did according to this promise.

{{verse|chapter=5|verse=14}}Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, ''that is'', twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=15}}But the former governors who were before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine from them, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants ruled over the people: but I didn’t do so, because of the fear of God. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=16}}Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered there to the work. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=17}}Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=18}}Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I didn’t demand the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy on this people. {{verse|chapter=5|verse=19}}Remember to me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.

==Chapter 6==
{{chapter|6}} {{verse|chapter=6|verse=1}}Now it happened, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;) {{verse|chapter=6|verse=2}}that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together in ''one of'' the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to harm me.

{{verse|chapter=6|verse=3}}I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that I can’t come down. Why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?” {{verse|chapter=6|verse=4}}They sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them the same way. {{verse|chapter=6|verse=5}}Then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand, {{verse|chapter=6|verse=6}}in which was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel. Because of that, you are building the wall. You would be their king, according to these words. {{verse|chapter=6|verse=7}}You have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.”

{{verse|chapter=6|verse=8}}Then I sent to him, saying, “There are no such things done as you say, but you imagine them out of your own heart.” {{verse|chapter=6|verse=9}}For they all would have made us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it not be done. But now, ''God'', strengthen my hands.”

{{verse|chapter=6|verse=10}}I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home; and he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to kill you; yes, in the night will they come to kill you.”

{{verse|chapter=6|verse=11}}I said, “Should such a man as I flee? Who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.” {{verse|chapter=6|verse=12}}I discerned, and behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. {{verse|chapter=6|verse=13}}He hired so that I would be afraid, do so, and sin, and that they might have material for an evil report, that they might reproach me. {{verse|chapter=6|verse=14}}“Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.”

{{verse|chapter=6|verse=15}}So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth ''day'' of ''the month'' Elul, in fifty-two days. {{verse|chapter=6|verse=16}}It happened, when all our enemies heard ''of it'', that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God. {{verse|chapter=6|verse=17}}Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and ''the letters'' of Tobiah came to them. {{verse|chapter=6|verse=18}}For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife. {{verse|chapter=6|verse=19}}Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

==Chapter 7==
{{chapter|7}} {{verse|chapter=7|verse=1}}Now it happened, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, {{verse|chapter=7|verse=2}}that I put my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, in charge of Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=3}}I said to them, “Don’t let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut the doors, and you bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, with everyone near his house.”

{{verse|chapter=7|verse=4}}Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=5}}My God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found written therein: {{verse|chapter=7|verse=6}}These are the children of the province, who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, everyone to his city; {{verse|chapter=7|verse=7}}who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel: {{verse|chapter=7|verse=8}}The children of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy-two. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=9}}The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy-two. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=10}}The children of Arah, six hundred fifty-two. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=11}}The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred ''and'' eighteen. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=12}}The children of Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=13}}The children of Zattu, eight hundred forty-five. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=14}}The children of Zaccai, seven hundred sixty. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=15}}The children of Binnui, six hundred forty-eight. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=16}}The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty-eight. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=17}}The children of Azgad, two thousand three hundred twenty-two. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=18}}The children of Adonikam, six hundred sixty-seven. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=19}}The children of Bigvai, two thousand sixty-seven. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=20}}The children of Adin, six hundred fifty-five. {{verse|chapter=7|verse=21}}The children of

{{chapter|8}} {{verse|chapter=8|verse=1}}All the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Yahweh had commanded to Israel. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=2}}Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=3}}He read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were ''attentive'' to the book of the law. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=4}}Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, ''and'' Meshullam. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=5}}Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up: {{verse|chapter=8|verse=6}}and Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God. All the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” with the lifting up of their hands. They bowed their heads, and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=7}}Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people ''stood'' in their place. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=8}}They read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=9}}Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, “This day is holy to Yahweh your God. Don’t mourn, nor weep.” For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=10}}Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Don’t be grieved; for the joy of Yahweh is your strength.”

{{verse|chapter=8|verse=11}}So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, “Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be grieved.”

{{verse|chapter=8|verse=12}}All the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=13}}On the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers’ ''houses'' of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=14}}They found written in the law, how that Yahweh had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month; {{verse|chapter=8|verse=15}}and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and get olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.”

{{verse|chapter=8|verse=16}}So the people went out, and brought them, and made themselves booths, everyone on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=17}}All the assembly of those who were come again out of the captivity made booths, and lived in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so. There was very great gladness. {{verse|chapter=8|verse=18}}Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God.

==Chapter 9==
{{chapter|9}} {{verse|chapter=9|verse=1}}Now in the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth on them. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=2}}The seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=3}}They stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day; and ''another'' fourth part they confessed, and worshiped Yahweh their God. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=4}}Then stood up on the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, ''and'' Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=5}}Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, ''and'' Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless Yahweh your God from everlasting to everlasting! Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise! {{verse|chapter=9|verse=6}}You are Yahweh, even you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their army, the earth and all things that are on it, the seas and all that is in them, and you preserve them all. The army of heaven worships you. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=7}}You are Yahweh, the God who chose Abram, and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham, {{verse|chapter=9|verse=8}}and found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous.

{{verse|chapter=9|verse=9}}“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea, {{verse|chapter=9|verse=10}}and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and made a name for yourself, as it is this day. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=11}}You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=12}}Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.

{{verse|chapter=9|verse=13}}“You came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments, {{verse|chapter=9|verse=14}}and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant, {{verse|chapter=9|verse=15}}and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.

{{verse|chapter=9|verse=16}}“But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, didn’t listen to your commandments, {{verse|chapter=9|verse=17}}and refused to obey, neither were they mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn’t forsake them. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=18}}Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed awful blasphemies; {{verse|chapter=9|verse=19}}yet you in your manifold mercies didn’t forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud didn’t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=20}}You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn’t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.

{{verse|chapter=9|verse=21}}“Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their clothes didn’t grow old, and their feet didn’t swell. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=22}}Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted according to their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=23}}You also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.

{{verse|chapter=9|verse=24}}“So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they pleased. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=25}}They took fortified cities, and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.

{{verse|chapter=9|verse=26}}“Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=27}}Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. In the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=28}}But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies, {{verse|chapter=9|verse=29}}and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and didn’t listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, (which if a man does, he shall live in them), turned their backs, stiffened their neck, and would not hear. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=30}}Yet many years you put up with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet would they not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.

{{verse|chapter=9|verse=31}}“Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=32}}Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, don’t let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=33}}However you are just in all that is come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly; {{verse|chapter=9|verse=34}}neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=35}}For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land which you gave before them, neither did they turn from their wicked works.

{{verse|chapter=9|verse=36}}“Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good, behold, we are servants in it. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=37}}It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our livestock, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress. {{verse|chapter=9|verse=38}}Yet for all this, we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, ''and'' our priests, seal to it.”

{{chapter|12}} {{verse|chapter=12|verse=1}}Now these are the priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, {{verse|chapter=12|verse=2}}Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, {{verse|chapter=12|verse=3}}Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, {{verse|chapter=12|verse=4}}Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, {{verse|chapter=12|verse=5}}Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, {{verse|chapter=12|verse=6}}Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah. {{verse|chapter=12|verse=7}}Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah.

''One went'' on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate; {{verse|chapter=12|verse=32}}and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, {{verse|chapter=12|verse=33}}and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, {{verse|chapter=12|verse=34}}Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, {{verse|chapter=12|verse=35}}and certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph; {{verse|chapter=12|verse=36}}and his brothers, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them. {{verse|chapter=12|verse=37}}By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward. {{verse|chapter=12|verse=38}}The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, on the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall, {{verse|chapter=12|verse=39}}and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard. {{verse|chapter=12|verse=40}}So stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me; {{verse|chapter=12|verse=41}}and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; {{verse|chapter=12|verse=42}}and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. {{verse|chapter=12|verse=43}}They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off. {{verse|chapter=12|verse=44}}On that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who waited. {{verse|chapter=12|verse=45}}They performed the duty of their God, and the duty of the purification, and ''so did'' the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son. {{verse|chapter=12|verse=46}}For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. {{verse|chapter=12|verse=47}}All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart ''that which was'' for the Levites; and the Levites set apart ''that which was'' for the sons of Aaron.

==Chapter 13==
{{chapter|13}} {{verse|chapter=13|verse=1}}On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever, {{verse|chapter=13|verse=2}}because they didn’t meet the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: however our God turned the curse into a blessing. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=3}}It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=4}}Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah, {{verse|chapter=13|verse=5}}had prepared for him a great chamber, where before they laid the meal offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the wave offerings for the priests. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=6}}But in all this ''time'' I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king, {{verse|chapter=13|verse=7}}and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=8}}It grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=9}}Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and there brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal offerings and the frankincense. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=10}}I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled everyone to his field. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=11}}Then I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” I gathered them together, and set them in their place. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=12}}Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=13}}I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=14}}Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don’t wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its observances. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=15}}In those days saw I in Judah some men treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys ''therewith''&lt;nowiki&gt;; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: and I testified &lt;/nowiki&gt;''against them'' in the day in which they sold food. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=16}}There lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=17}}Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day? {{verse|chapter=13|verse=18}}Didn’t your fathers do thus, and didn’t our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”

{{verse|chapter=13|verse=19}}It came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I set some of my servants over the gates, that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=20}}So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=21}}Then I testified against them, and said to them, “Why do you stay around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they didn’t come on the Sabbath. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=22}}I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=23}}In those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, ''and'' of Moab: {{verse|chapter=13|verse=24}}and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=25}}I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, ''saying'', “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=26}}Didn’t Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=27}}Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?”

{{verse|chapter=13|verse=28}}One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=29}}Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites. {{verse|chapter=13|verse=30}}Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners, and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work; {{verse|chapter=13|verse=31}}and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.

The above headline is clearly an exaggeration, but it is based on the style of reporting adopted recently by the Times of London in its coverage of Sri Lanka. Following its extraordinary assertion, at the end of May, that over 20,000 had been killed in the conflict area, it seemed necessary to examine the motives behind such whopping untruths. The investigation revealed a culture of secretiveness and propagandist zeal that is not of course novel, given the role that some newspapers have played in the past in supporting British adventurism, as instigated by particular political parties.


An expedition to London found that the Times itself was unwilling to provide access. Like Channel 4, which had been equally fraudulent, it kept its doors tight shut. However four other journals and two TV channels were more open, and provided some explanation of the deceit practiced by the Times.


‘The Times is in the pocket of New Labour,’ said one senior journalist. ‘They get all their material from the Foreign Office.’


Another journalist speculated that the British Foreign Office was furious at the own goal it had achieved in Geneva, when its efforts to instigate a Special Session against Sri Lanka, and then to have a critical resolution passed, backfired when the whole Third World combined to administer a stinging rebuke. Even the Americans had advised against such folly, but thinking that Britain had asserted its primacy with regard to South Asia over the new American administration, David Miliband had forged (that being the operative word) ahead.
Failure had then prompted a determination to take revenge, hence the unleashing of the Times.


Other commentators however opined that Foreign Office professionals had not been in favour of the move, and that more seasoned diplomats, though they had had to succumb to New Labour pressure, were pleased that the rebuke had allowed greater weight to more enlightened professional opinion. Their view was that positive engagement, based on British concern for Human Rights, but without any devious political agenda, which could also be seen as threatening to India, would achieve more in ensuring that Sri Lanka adhered to its traditional policy of neutrality. 


Though for some weeks the saner minds in the Foreign Office had seemed to prevail, the latest effusion in the Times suggests that its handlers are once again champing at their own bits. Now the claim is that ‘about 1,400 people a week are dying at one of the big internment camps,’ This is attributed to ‘Senior international aid figures’, though as usual the Times is unwilling to name these mythical figures.


The response of the UN Resident Coordinator to this claim was ‘Ridiculous’, and he could not even guess as to how the Times had arrived at this figure. It was possible he said that a zero had been added on, but even 140 was higher than the actual figure. Currently it averages under 5 deaths a day, while in the period from May 1st it has been 618 altogether, with higher figures in May when there was an influx, just as there had been averages of over 10 a day in the first few days after the massive influx of April 20th onward. 618 deaths in 75 days out of a total of nearly 300,000 people is not especially strange, and well within the SPHERE norms for such situations.


The Times, or perhaps its minders, who have smuggled in their agents in the guise of aid workers (at massive salaries, it should be noted, and relentlessly disruptive of the good work of most aid agencies), knows how to introduce figures by sleight of hand. The figures it now confidently attributes to the UN were leaked, and that from tentative extrapolations, and UN Emergency Relief Coordinator John Holmes has made it clear that they were never formally issued because they were only estimates. Holmes went further in totally repudiating the Times claim about over 20,000 dead, when he said that it had no basis in anything said or recorded by the UN.


In fact the Times had cleverly tried to insinuate that the UN was responsible for that figure by first citing the leaked UN figure of 7,000 for the first four months of the year, and then using a semi-colon (how Orwell would have relished that!) to assert that there was an average of 1,000 a day over the next two weeks. Some gullible papers had then claimed UN authority for the 20,000, though fortunately that canard has now been nailed, and when it recurs, generally only in the Times, it is now attributed to the Times alone.


The reason for the current attack may be related to the admission of doctors who had been in the conflict area that they had lied about casualty figures under Tiger pressure. That this was happening had been evident at the time but, though the Sri Lankan government had noted this, the Times and its allies had cited such figures as gospel. It was only after the admission of the doctors that the Times finally noted that ‘It would be surprising if the Tigers, who were no slouches when it came to the manipulation of the media, had not attempted to modify the doctors’ testimonies’.


This belated admission was made however only to claim that the Tigers and the Government are just like each other. What is bizarre is that, if the Times, albeit through a series of what are in effect self-effacing double negatives, grants that the Tigers got the doctors to make things up, it now blames the government for having the doctors issue a corrective. Such correctives would never have been necessary if the Times and its minders had made it clear from the start that the figures cited by the doctors under Tiger duress were unreliable.


And, interestingly enough, even this concession seems to be missing from later versions of the article, since obviously nothing should take away from the assault on the government. After all the doctors had been brought into play over the 20,000 figure, even though it had nothing whatsoever to do with them. Any study of the chronology would have made that clear, but the Times assumes that its readers are not going to study anything, and that the bigger the lie, and the more diabolical the insinuation, the more likely it is that it will be repeated by gullible followers.


Thus the Times claims that ‘The United Nations found that more than 7,000 civilians were killed between January and May. Subsequent aerial photographs of beach graves, revealed in The Times, suggested that the figure was more than 20,000. World outrage embarrassed the Colombo Government. The doctors were swiftly arrested and nothing further was heard of them until Wednesday.’


This ignores the fact that the ‘revelation’ in the Times, passed off as having UN authority, occurred at the end of the week in May in which the New Labour initiative in Geneva had so dismally failed. The doctors had been arrested over 10 days earlier, as they escaped the conflict zone together with thousands of other civilians when Tiger resistance finally collapsed, and the cadres stopped – to a great extent if not totally – firing on the fleeing masses they had held hostage for so long. This hostage taking, it should be noted, was with the connivance of the Times and its Tiger sympathizers (as described by senior Sri Lankan journalists) such as Marie Colvin. 


Why does the Times love the Tigers so much, to the extent of suppressing initially and subsequently what they did with the doctors? Why does it hate the Sri Lankan government to the extent of telling ridiculous lies, as described by senior responsible aid officials? Why does it twist evidence and chronology, hell bent it seems on attacking the government with no regard for journalistic or even basic human ethics?


The answer obviously lies in its political agenda. No wonder that a senior British diplomat, when told that a Conservative victory was anxiously awaited, said the sentiments were widely shared. A professional Foreign Office needs better leadership than it has now, it needs better agents than the Times in its current phase of amoral secretive falsehood. It is no wonder that other journalists said there was no reason to worry about the Times, since its circulation was very small. But still, as with Browning on Wordsworth, Byron on Venice, those who remember past glories can only weep at what the current management of the Times has done, in enslaving past glory to New Labour manipulation. To paraphrase the Times itself, ‘It would be surprising if New Labour, who are no slouches when it came to the manipulation of the media, had not attempted to pervert the reporting of the Times’.

'''CHAPTER XII'''



WHEN I regained my senses, the killing of Spy appeared to me a monstrous crime. I was as horrified as if I had killed a child. Of all the cowardly acts committed I thought that was the most cowardly and loathsome! To kill Juliette! That would have been a crime, of 
course, but perhaps there could be found, if not 
an excuse, at least a reason for that crime in the 
revolt of my anguish. But to kill Spy! A dog. . . 
a poor, inoffensive creature! Why? For no other 
reason than that I was a brute, that I had in me the 
savage and irresistible instinct of a murderer! During the war I had killed a man who was kindly, young and strong, and I had killed him just at the moment when, fascinated, with beating heart, he was rapturously watching the rising sun ! I had killed him while 
hidden behind a tree, concealed by the shadow, like 
a coward! He was a Prussian? What difference does 
it make ! He, too, was a human being, a man like myself, better than myself. Upon his life were depending the feeble lives of women and children ; a portion of suffering humanity was praying for him, waiting 
for him ; perhaps in that virile youth, in that robust 
body that was his, he had the germs of those superior 
beings for whom humanity had been living in hope? 
And with one shot from an idiotic, trembling gun I 
had destroyed all that. And now I killed a dog! . . . 
and killed it when it was coming toward me, when 
it was trying with its little paws to climb on my lap ! 
Verily, I was an assassin ! That small cadaver haunted 
me, I always saw that head hideously crushed, the 
blood squirting all over the white clothes of the bedroom, and the bed indelibly stained with blood. 

What was also tormenting was the thought that 
Juliette would never forgive me the loss of Spy. She 
would be horrified at the mere sight of me. I wrote 
her letters of repentance, assured her that from now on 
I was going to be satisfied with what little attention 
she might give me, that I would never again complain, that I was not going to reproach her for her behavior; my letters were so humble, so self-degrading, so vilely submissive that a person other than 
Juliette would feel disgusted on reading them. I sent 
them with a messenger whose return I would anxiously await on the corner of the Rue de Balzac. 

&quot;No answer!&quot; 

&quot;Are you sure you did not give it to the wrong 
person? Did you deliver it to the party on the first 
floor?&quot; 

&quot; Yes, Monsieur. The maid even said to me : 'No 
answer ! ' &quot; 

I went to her house. The door was opened only 
to the extent allowed by the chain lock which Juliette, 
fearing me, had ordered put on, since the evening of 
that terrible scene ; and through the half-opened space 
I could see the mocking and cynical face of Celestine. 

&quot; Madame is not in ! &quot; 

&quot; Celestine, my good Celestine, let me in, please ! &quot; 

&quot; Madame is not in ! &quot; 

&quot; Celestine ! My dear little Celestine. Let me go 
in and wait for her. I'll give you a lot of money.&quot; 

&quot; Madame is not in ! &quot; 

&quot; Celestine, I beg of you ! Go and tell Madame that 
I am here, that I am all right now. . . that I am very 
sick. . . that I am going to die! And you shall have 
a hundred francs, Celestine. . . two hundred francs ! &quot; 

Celestine looked at me slyly, with a mocking air, 
happy to see me suffer, happy above all to see a man 
reduced to her own level, begging servilely to her. 

&quot; For just one minute, Celestine. I'll just look at 
her and go away 1 &quot; 

&quot; No, no, Monsieur ! She'll scold me ! &quot; 

The ringing of a bell was heard. I heard the noise 
of it quicken. 

&quot; You see, Monsieur, she is calling me ! &quot; 

&quot; Well, now ! Celestine, tell her that if she does not 
come to my house by six o'clock, if she does not write 
to me by six o'clock. . . tell her that I am going to kill 
myself ! Six o'clock, Celestine 1 Don't forget now. . . 
tell her that I am going to kill myself ! &quot; 

&quot; All right, Monsieur ! &quot; 

The door was shut behind me with the clang of a 
chained lock. 

It occurred to me to see Gabrielle Bernier, to tell 
her my troubles, to ask her advice, and use her offices 
for a reconciliation with Juliette. Gabrielle was finishing breakfast with a friend of hers, a short, skinny woman of dark complexion, with a pointed chin like a mouse which when speaking seemed always to be 
nibbling at something. In a morning robe of white 
silk, soiled and rumpled, her hair kept from falling by 
a comb stuck across it on top of her head, her elbows 
resting on the table, Gabrielle was smoking a cigarette 
and sipping chartreuse from a glass. 

&quot; Why, Jean ! And so you have come back? &quot; 

She showed me into her dressing room which was 
very untidy. At the very first words which I spoke 
of Juliette, she exclaimed : 

&quot;Why. . . don't you know? We have not been on 
speaking terms for two months since the time she 
beat me out of a consul, my dear, an American Consul, 
who paid me five thousand a month ! Yes, she beat 
me out of it, that skinflint did! And how about you? 
You have made her come down a peg lower, I hope.&quot; 

&quot; Ah ! I ! &quot; I answered, &quot; I am very unhappy ! And so 
a consul is her lover now ! &quot; 

Gabrielle relit her extinguished cigarette and 
shrugged her shoulders. 

&quot; Her lover ! Do you think women like that can 
keep a lover ! She could not keep the Lord himself, my 
dear ! Ah, men don't stick to her very long, I tell you. 
They come one day and then the next they pitch camp 
somewhere else. Well, thanks very much ! It's all 
right to fleece them but you must do it with your 
gloves on, don't you think? And you are still in love 
with her, poor boy.&quot; 

&quot; Still why I am more so than ever ! I have done 
everything to cure myself of this shameful infatuation which makes me the lowest of men, which kills me, but I can't. Well now, she is leading a loathsome life, isn't she?&quot; 

&quot;Ah! Well. . . that's true,&quot; Gabrielle exclaimed, 
blowing a cloud of smoke in the air. &quot; You know that 
I myself don't play the prude. I am enjoying myself 
just like everybody else. . . but honestly. . . I can 
swear. ... I'd feel ashamed to do what she does ! &quot; 

With head turned, she was emitting coils of smoke 
which rose tremblingly toward the ceiling. And to 
emphasize what she had just said : 

&quot; That's the truth I am telling you,&quot; she repeated. 

Although I suffered cruelly, although every word 
of Gabrielle cut my heart as with a knife, I came up 
to her and coaxingly: 

&quot; Come, my little Gabrielle,&quot; I begged her, &quot; tell me 
all about her ! &quot; 

&quot; Tell you ! . . tell you ! Wait now ! You know 
the two Borgsheim brothers. . . those two dirty Germans! Well, Juliette was with both of them at the same time. I saw that myself, you know ! At the same time, mind you, my dear! One night she said to one 
of them : ' Ah well ! It is you that I love ! ' And she 
led him away. The next day she said to the other: 
' No, it is positively you ! ' And she led him away. 
And you should have seen them! Two wretched 
Prussians who haggled over the bill! And a lot of 
other things. But I don't want to tell you anything 
because I see I hurt you.&quot; 

&quot; No ! &quot; I exclaimed, &quot; no, Gabrielle, go on, because. 
. . . you understand. After all the disgust. . . the 
disgust. . . .&quot; 

I was choking. I burst into sobs. 

Gabrielle was trying to console me. 

&quot; Come ! Come now. . . . Poor Jean ! Don't cry ! 
She does not deserve all this grief! Such a nice boy 
as you are ! I can't see how that is possible ! I always 
used to tell her : ' You don't understand him, my 
dear, you never did understand him, a man like that 
is a jewel ! ' Ah ! I know some women who would 
be mighty glad to have a man like you. . . and who 
would love you very much ! &quot; 

She sat down on my lap and wanted to dry the tears 
from my eyes. Her voice became soft and her eyes 
luminous : 

&quot; Have a little courage. Cut loose from her ! Get 
another one, one who is kind and gentle, one who 
would understand you. Can't you see ? &quot; 

And suddenly, she threw her arms around me and 
fastened her mouth upon my own. Her bare breast 
which rolled out from under the lace of her peignoir 
was pressing against my chest. This kiss, this exposed portion of her body horrified me. I freed myself from her embrace, I rudely pushed Gabrielle away, she straightened up again somewhat abashed, fixed 
her dress and said to me: 

&quot; Yes, I understand ! I have had the same feeling. 
But, you know, dear. Whenever you want to. . . 
come to see me.&quot; 

I left. My legs were shaking, around my head I 
felt rings of lead; a cold sweat covered my face and 
rolled in titillating drops down my back. In order 
to walk I had to hold on to the house walls, as I was 
on the verge of fainting. I walked into a cafe and 
avidly gulped down a few draughts of rum. I could 
not say that I suffered much. It was a sort of stupor 
that rendered my members inactive, a kind of physical 
and mental prostration in which from time to time 
the thought of Juliette brought with it the sensation of 
a sharp, lancinating odor. And in my disordered 
mind Juliette was losing her identity; it was no 
longer a woman who had an individual existence 
that I saw, it was prostitution itself with its immense, outstretched body covering the entire world; it was lust personified, eternally defiled, toward which panting multitudes were rushing across the shadow 
of woeful nights, pierced by torches carried by monstrous idols. ... I remained there a long time, my elbows on the table, my head buried in my hands, with gaze fixed between two mirrors upon a panel on 
which flowers were painted. 

At last I left the cafe and walked and walked 
ahead, without knowing where I was going. After 
a long course and without the least intention of 
getting there, I found myself in the Avenue 
Bois-de-Boulogne, near the Arc de Triomphe. The 
sun was beginning to set. Above the hills of Saint 
Cloud which took on a violet tinge, the sky was 
a glorious purple, and little pink clouds were wandering upon the pallid blue expanse. The woods stood out as a solid mass, grown darker, a fine dust reddened by the reflection of a setting sun rose from the avenue 
black with carriages. And the dense mass of carriages, 
congested into interminable lines, were passing without end, carrying human birds of prey to nocturnal carnages. Reclining on their cushions, indolent and disdainful, with stupid countenances and flabby flesh, 
exhaling a putrid odor, they were all there, so nearly 
alike that I recognized Juliette in each one of them. 
The line of vehicles appeared to me more lugubrious 
than ever. As I looked at these horses, this diversity 
of colors, this crimson sun which made the glass panes 
of the carriages shine like breastplates, all this intense intermingling of colors red, yellow, blue all these plumes that swayed in the wind, I had the impression of looking at some enemy regiments, regiments of an army of conquest ready to fall upon vanquished foes, drunk foes, drunk with a desire for pillage. And quite seriously I was indignant over 
the fact that I did not hear the roar of cannons, did 
not hear the mitrailleuses spitting death and sweeping the avenue with fire. A laborer who was returning from work stopped at the end of the sidewalk. With tools on his shoulder and crooked back, he was watching the street. Not only did he have no hatred in his 
eyes but there was a sort of ecstasy in them. Anger 
seized me. I wanted to come up to him, grab him by 
the collar and cry out: 

&quot; What are you doing here, you fool ? Why do you 
look at these women so? These women who are an 
insult to your torn coat, to your arms trembling with 
fatigue, to your whole wretched body emaciated by 
daily hardships 1 In the days of revolution you 
thought you could avenge yourself upon society which 
kept you down by killing soldiers and priests, humble 
and suffering human beings like yourself? And you 
never thought of erecting scaffolds for these infamous 
creatures, for these ferocious beasts who steal from you 
your bread, your sun. Look ! Society which is so cruel 
to you, which tries to make ever heavier the 
chains that hold you riveted to eternal misery, that 
society offers them protection and riches ; the drops of 
your blood it transforms into gold with which to 
cover the flabby bosoms of these despicable creatures. 
It is in order that they may live in palaces that you 
are spending your strength, that you are dying from 
hunger or that they break your head on the barricades. 
Look! When you beg for bread on the streets the 
police beat you with clubs, you poor wretch ! But see 
how they make way for their coachmen and horses! 
Look ! What a juicy grape-gathering they have ! Ah ! 
these vintage tubs of blood ! And how on earth can 
the pure wheat grow tall and nourishing in the soil 
where these creatures rot ! &quot; 

Suddenly I saw Juliette. I saw her for a second, in 
profile. She wore a pink hat, looked fresh, was smiling; she seemed happy. Answering greetings with a 
slow motion of her head, Juliette did not see me. . . . 
She passed on. 

She is going to my house! She has come back to 
her senses. She is going to my house! 

I was sure of it. An empty carriage passed by. I 
went in. Juliette had disappeared. 

&quot; If I could only get there at the same time she 
does. For I know she is going to my house! Hurry 
up, driver, hurry up ! &quot; 

There is no carriage in front of the door of the furnished house. Juliette is already gone. I rushed down to the caretaker. 

&quot; Was there someone here a minute ago asking about 
me? Was it a lady? Mme. Juliette Roux?&quot; 

&quot; Why no, Monsieur Mintie.&quot; 

&quot;Well, is there a letter for me?&quot; 

&quot; Nothing, Monsieur Mintie. &quot; 

I was thinking: 

&quot; She'll be here in a minute ! &quot; 

I waited. No one came! I continued waiting. Nobody came! Time passed. And still no one came! 

&quot; The contemptible creature ! And she was still 
smiling! And she looked gay! And she knew that I 
was going to kill myself at six o'clock ! &quot; 

I ran to the Rue de Balzac. Celestine assured me 
that Madame had just gone out. 

&quot; Listen, Celestine, you are a nice girl. I like you 
very much. Do you know where she is? Go and find 
her and tell her that I want to see her.&quot; 

&quot; But I don't know where Madame is.&quot; 

&quot; Yes, you do, Celestine. I implore you. Please 
go ! I suffer so ! &quot; 

&quot; Upon my word of honor ! Monsieur, I don't know 
where she is. &quot; 

I insisted: 

&quot; Perhaps she is at her lover's ? At the restaurant. 
Oh, tell me where she is! . . .&quot; 

&quot; But I don't know ! &quot; 

I was getting impatient. 

&quot; Celestine, I have been trying to be nice to you. 
Don't make me lose my temper. . . because. . . .&quot; 

Celestine crossed her arms, shook her head and in 
the drawling voice of a blackguard: 

&quot; Because what? Oh, I am getting tired of you, you 
miserable wretch, you ! And if you don't betake yourself from here in a hurry, I am going to call the police, do you hear? &quot; 

And pushing me rudely toward the door she added : 

&quot; Yes, I mean it ! These sluts here are worse than 
dogs ! &quot; 

I had sense enough not to start a quarrel with 
Celestine and, burning with shame, I went down the 
stairway. 

It was midnight when I returned to the Rue de 
Balzac. I had gone through several restaurants, my 
eyes seeking Juliette in the mirrors, through curtain 
openings. I had gone into a few theatres. At the 
Hippodrome where she used to go on subscription 
days I had made a search of the stalls. This large 
place, with its dazzling lights, above all, this orchestra 
which played a slow and languid air all this had unstrung my nerves and made me cry ! I had approached groups of men, thinking that they might be talking about Juliette and that I might perhaps learn something. And every time I saw a man dressed in evening clothes, I had said to myself: 

&quot; Perhaps that's her lover ! &quot; 

What was I doing here? It seemed it was my fate 
to run after her everywhere, always, to live on the 
sidewalk, at the door of evil places and wait for 
Juliette ! Exhausted with fatigue, a buzzing sensation 
in my head, unable to find a trace of Juliette, I had 
found myself on the street again. And I was waiting ! 
For what? Really, I did not know. I was waiting 
for everything and nothing at the same time. I was 
there either to bring myself as a voluntary offering 
once more or to commit some crime. I was hoping 
that Juliette would come home alone. Then I thought 
I would go up to her and move her to pity with my 
words. I was also afraid I might see her in the company of a man. Then I would perhaps kill her. But I was not premeditating anything. I had simply come here, that's all ! To surpise her all the better, I hid 
myself in the shadow of the door of the house next to 
her own. 

From there I could observe everything without 
being seen, if it were necessary not to show myself. 
I did not have to wait very long. A hackney coach 
coming from Faubourg Saint Honore, passed into the 

Rue de Balzac, crossed the street diagonally to the 
side where I was standing and, grazing the sidewalk, 
stopped in front of Juliette's house ! I held my breath. 
My whole body trembled, shaken by convulsions. 
Juliette came out first. I recognized her at once. She 
ran across the sidewalk and I heard her pull the handle 
of the door bell. Then a man came out ; it seemed to 
me that I knew the man also. He came to the lamp 
post, searched in his pocketbook and awkwardly took 
out a few silver pieces which he examined by the light 
with upraised arm. And his shadow upon the ground 
assumed an angular and monstrous form! I wanted 
to rush out of my place of hiding. Something heavy 
held me nailed to the ground. I wanted to shout. The 
cry was throttled in my throat. At the same time a 
chill rose from my heart to my brains. I had a feeling 
as though life were slowly leaving my body. I made 
a superhuman effort and with tottering steps I went 
toward the man. The door was opened and Juliette 
disappeared through it, saying: 

&quot; Well, are you coming? &quot; 

The man was still searching in his pocketbook. 

It was Lirat ! Had the houses, the very sky crashed 
upon my head my astonishment would have been no 
greater! Lirat going home with Juliette. That could 
not be ! I had lost my senses ! I came still closer. 

&quot;Lirat!&quot; I cried out, &quot;Lirat! . . .&quot; 

He had paid the coachman and looked at me, terrified! Motionless, with gaping mouth, with outspread legs he was looking at me, without saying a word ! 

&quot;Lirat! Is that you? It is not possible! It is not 
you, is it? You look like Lirat but you are not Lirat! &quot; 

Lirat was silent. . . . 

&quot; Come, Lirat ! You are not going to do that. . . or 
I shall say that you have sent me away to Ploch in 
order to steal Juliette from me! You here, with herl 

Why that's preposterous ! Lirat ! Remember what you 
told me about her. . . think of the beautiful things 
which you had planted in my soul. This despicable 
woman! Why she is good only for one like me who 
am lost. But you ! You are an honorable man, you are 
a great artist! Is it to revenge yourself on me that 
you are doing this? A man like you does not revenge 
himself in such a manner ! He does not besmirch himself! If I did not come to see you it was because I feared to incur your anger ! Come, speak to me, Lirat. Answer me ! &quot; 

Lirat was silent. Juliette was calling him in the 
hallway : 

&quot;Well, are you coming?&quot; 

I seized Lirat's hands: 

&quot; Look here Lirat. . . she is mocking you. Don't 
you understand it? One day she said to me: ' I shall 
revenge myself on Lirat for his contempt, for his 
arrogant harshness ! And that will be a farce ! ' She 
is having that revenge now. You are going into her 
house, aren't you. . . and tomorrow, tonight, this very 
minute, perhaps, she will chase you out in disgrace! 
Yes, that is what she is after, I can swear ! Ah ! Now 
I understand it all! She has pursued you! Foolish 
as she is, infinitely inferior to you as she is, she has 
known how to turn your head. She has a genius 
for evil, and you are chaste in body and mind ! She 
has poured poison into your veins. But you are strong ! 
You can't do this after all that has taken place between us. ... or else you are a depraved man, a dirty pig, you whom I admire! You are a dirty pig! Come 
now ! &quot; 

Lirat suddenly wriggled out of my hold, and, pushing me away with his two clenched fists: 

&quot; Well, yes ! &quot; he shouted, &quot; I am a dirty pig ! Leave 
me alone ! &quot; 

A dull noise was heard which resounded in the air 
like a thunderbolt. It was the door shut after Lirat. 
The houses, the sky, the lights of the street were in 
a whirl. And I no longer saw anything. I stretched 
out my arms in front of me and fell on the sidewalk. 
Then in the midst of peaceful cornfields I saw a road, 
a white road upon which a man, seemingly tired, was 
walking. The man never stopped looking at the beautiful corn which ripened in the sun, and at the broad 
meadows where flocks of gamboling sheep grazed, 
their snouts buried in the grass. Apple-trees stretched 
out to him their branches weighted down with the 
purple fruit, and the springs purled at the bottom of 
their moss-covered recesses in the ground. He seated 
himself upon the bank of a river covered at this spot 
with little fragrant flowers, and listened rapturously 
to the music of nature. . . . From everywhere voices 
which rose up from the earth, voices which came down 
from heaven, soft voices were murmuring : &quot; Come 
to me all ye who suffer, all ye who have sinned. We 
are the comforters who will restore to wretched people their repose of life and their peace of conscience. Come to us all ye who wish to live ! &quot; And the man with arms uplifted to heaven prayed : &quot;Yes, I wish to 
live! What must I do in order not to suffer? What 
must I do in order not to sin?&quot; The trees shook their 
crowns, the corn field moved its sea of stubble, a buzzing arose from every grass blade, the flowers swayed their little corollas on top of their stems, and from all this a unique voice was heard : &quot; Love us ! &quot; said the 
voice. The man resumed his walk, birds were fluttering all around him. 

The next day I bought a suit of working clothes. 

&quot; And so Monsieur is going away ! &quot; asked the errand 
boy of the premises to whom I had just given my old 
clothes. 

&quot; Yes, my friend ! &quot; 

&quot; And where is Monsieur going? &quot; 

&quot; I don't know.&quot; 

On the street, men appeared to me like mad ghosts, 
old skeletons out of joint, whose bones, badly strung 
together, were falling to the pavement with a strange 
noise. I saw the necks turning on top of broken spinal 
columns, hanging upon disjointed clavicles, arms sundered from the trunks, the trunks themselves losing their shape. And all these scraps of human bodies, stripped of their flesh by death, were rushing upon 
one another, forever spurred on by a homicidal fever, 
forever driven by pleasure, and they were righting over 
foul carrion.

Italian humanist and philosopher born of a noble family at Cosenza, near Naples, 1508; died there, 1588. He studied successively at Milan, Rome, and Padua. In Southern Italy the revolt against Aristoteleanism had already begun. At Padua Telesio first came to be recognized as a leader of the anti-Aristoteleans. After residing several years in Rome, where he enjoyed the patronage of Paul IV, Telesio returned to Naples, and later founded an academy at Cosenza. His principal work is entitled &quot;De rerum natura juxta propria principia&quot;, the first part of which was published in Rome, 1565, and the second in Naples, 1587. He was a radical opponent both of the method and of the content of Aristotelean philosophy. He considered that the scholastic followers of Aristotle relied too much on reason and too little on the senses. The &quot;reasoners&quot;, he believed, were over-confident of their power to reach the secrets of nature by syllogistic methods. With conscious humility, therefore, he determined to trust to his senses alone, and, beginning &quot;in the dust&quot;, he strove to reach the highest pinnacle of natural truth. This exclusion of reason from the task and the consequent exaltation of sense above every other faculty of the mind resulted naturally in the sensistic doctrine that all knowledge is feeling (''sensus'') or sensation, and in the materialistic doctrine that the soul itself is material. In the content of his philosophy he opposed the Aristotelean doctrine of matter and form, substituting for it the doctrine that everything is composed of matter and force, the two principal forces being heat and cold. Heat is centralized in the sun, and cold in the earth. As the Platonist Patrizzi pointed out, there is an inherent contradiction in Telesio's system. For, if we are to rely on the senses and not on reason, since the senses do not reveal the existence of matter except as modified by forces, the central doctrinal principle is in contradiction with the most important methodological tenet. This point was brought out in the discussions between the advocates of Aristotle and the followers of Telesio in the sixteenth century. Among the most ardent disciples of Telesio were Campanella and Giordano Bruno.

Lecturer and controversialist, born at Ashfield, Queens County, Ireland 28 November, 1796; died at Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A., 28 October, 1864. The third son of Daniel Cahill, a civil engineer, he was sent to Carlow College, and in 1816 entered Maynooth, where he became proficient in natural philosophy and languages. He was ordained a priest after he had passed through the Dunboyne establishment, and in 1825 was appointed professor of natural philosophy at Carlow College where he taught for some years. He then opened a school at Seapoint, Williamstown, which he conducted from 1835 to 1841. Meanwhile he wrote largely for the press, and for a time edited the Dublin &quot;Telegraph&quot;. He became a distinguished preacher and lecturer, and his vigorous attacks on the government and the Established Church of Ireland extended his reputation in all directions. In December, 1859, he visited the United States and lectured on Astronomy and other scientific subjects, and preached in many American and Canadian cities. As he generally gave his services for religious and charitable purposes, large sums of money were raised by him for Catholic objects. He was of commanding presence, being six feet five inches in height, and extremely handsome. He was buried in Boston, but his body was exumed in 1885 and taken to Ireland, where it was buried in Glasnevin Cemetary, Dublin. His writings consist chiefly of lectures and addresses, with some letters to prominent Protestants. The most important of them were collected and published in Dublin in 1886 under the title &quot;Life, Letters, and Lectures of Rev. Dr. Cahill&quot;.

This is the name given to a cloth of rectangular shape about 8 ft. long and 1 1/2 ft. wide. The &quot;Cæremoniale Romanum (l. I, c. x, n. 5) requires that it should be of silk. The edges are usually fringed, while a cross, with the name &quot;Jesus&quot;, or some other representation adorns the centre. Humeral veils for use on festivals are often richly embroidered. To prevent too rapid wearing out by usage, pockets or flaps (wings) are provided well under the lower edges, towards the ends. These are then used instead of the veil itself to hold the object which is to be covered by the latter. Flaps (wings) are not advisable; but there can be no serious objection to pockets. The humeral veil is worn so as to cover the back and shoulders — hence its name — and its two ends hang down in front. To prevent its falling from the shoulders, it is fastened across the breast with clasps or ribbons attached to the border. The humeral veil is used:



* at solemn high Mass, by the subdeacon, who holds the paten with it from the close of the Offertory until after the Pater Noster (&quot;Ritus celebr.&quot;, vii, 9, in &quot;Missale Rom.&quot; ; &quot;Cærem. Episc.&quot; 1. I, c. x, n. 6; II, viii, 60);

* at a pontifical Mass, by the acolyte, who bears the bishop's mitre, unless he be wearing the cope (Cæremon. Epis., I, xi, 6);

* by the priest or bishop in processions of the Blessed Sacrament, in giving Benediction, in carrying the Host to its repository on Holy Thursday, and bringing it back to the altar on Good Friday, and finally in taking the Viaticum to the sick (see rit. for Fer. V. in Coena Domini, and Fer. VI. in Parasceve, in &quot;Miss. Rom.&quot;; &quot;Cæremon. episc.&quot;, 1. II, c. xxiii, n. 11, 13; xxv, 31, 32; xxxiii, 27; &quot;Rituale Rom.&quot;, Tit. IV, c. iv, n. 9; v, 3).

In processions of the Blessed Sacrament, and at Benediction given with the ostensorium, only the hands are placed under the humeral veil; in other cases it covers the sacred vessel which contains the Host. In the cases mentioned under the third heading the humeral veil must always be white. No specific colour is prescribed in the case: of the mitre-bearer but the veil worn by the subdeacon who bears the paten must be of the same colour as the other vestments. There is no black humeral veil, for the reason that at Masses for the dead, as well as on Good Friday, the paten remains on the altar.


'''History'''

It is impossible to determine when the Roman Ritual first prescribed the use of the humeral veil on the occasions mentioned above under (3). It was probably towards the close of the Middle Ages. The custom is first alluded to in &quot;Ordo Rom. XV&quot; (c. lxxvii). In many places outside of Rome the humeral veil was not adopted for the aforesaid functions until very recent times. It was prescribed in Milan, by St. Charles Borromeo, for processions of the Blessed Sacrament and for carrying Holy Viaticum to the sick. Its use at high Mass dates back as far at least as the eighth century, for it was mentioned, under the name of ''sindon'', in the oldest Roman Ordo. It undoubtedly goes back to a more remote antiquity. But, in those days, it was not the subdeacon who held the paten with it; this office was performed by an acolyte. Moreover, not only this particular acolyte, but all acolytes who had charge of sacred vessels wore the humeral veil. That of the paten-bearer was distinguished by a cross. One may find an interesting reproduction of acolytes with alb and humeral veil (''sindon'') in a ninth century miniature of a sacramentary (reproduced in Braun, Die liturgische Gewandung p. 62), in the seminary of Autun sometime in the eleventh century the custom was inaugurated of having the paten borne, no longer by an acolyte, but by the subdeacon; this was especially the case at Rome. The subdeacon then had no humeral veil, but rather held the paten with the pall (''mappula, palla, sudarium''), the forerunner of our chalice veil, the ends of which were thrown over the right shoulder. Thus it is prescribed by Ordo Rom. XIV (c. liii), and so it may be seen in various reproductions. The acolyte continued, even in the later Middle Ages, to use a humeral veil (''palliolum, sindon, mantellum'') when carrying the paten, and the present Roman custom, according to which the subdeacon is vested in the humeral veil when holding the paten, originated at the close of the Middle Ages. It was slow in finding its way into use outside of Rome, and was not adopted in certain countries (France, Germany) until the nineteenth century. The veil used by the mitre-bearer is mentioned as far back as Ordo Rom. XIV (c. xlviii).

&lt;b&gt;Parmenianus&lt;/b&gt;, successor to Donatus the Great, who followed Majorinus as 
Donatist bp. of Carthage. Optatus calls him &quot;peregrines,&quot; ''i.e.'' probably not 
a native of Africa. Having adopted Donatist opinions, he succeeded Donatus ''c.'' 
350, was banished {{small-caps|a.d.}} 358, and returned under the decree of Julian 
{{small-caps|a.d.}} 362 (Aug.
''Retract.'' ii. 17; Eus. ''Chron.'' ap. Hieron. ''Opp.'' vol. iii. p. 
687). About this time, if not earlier, he published a work, not now extant, in five 
parts, in defence of Donatism, to which the treatise of Optatus is a reply. About 
372 Tichonius, a Donatist, well versed in Scripture, becoming sensible of the narrow 
and exclusive views of the sect, wrote a book to condemn them, but without abandoning 
his party. Parmenian replied, condemning the doctrine of Tichonius as tending to 
connect the true church, that of the Donatists, with the corrupt one, the Catholic, 
especially its African branch. A council of 270 Donatist bishops was convened at 
Carthage, which sat for 75 days and at last resolved that &quot;traditors,&quot; even if they 
refused rebaptism, should be admitted to communion (Aug. ''Ep.'' 93, 43).

The time of this council is not known. Parmenian died and was succeeded by Primian
''c.'' 392; but his book against Tichonius fell into the hands of St. Augustine, 
who, at the request of his friends, discussed it in a treatise in three books,
''c.'' 402–405 (Tillem. xiii. 128 and note 32). For a full account of the treatise, 
with a list of Scripture quotations, see Ribbek, ''Donatus und Augustinus'', 
pp. 348–366. (See also Aug. ''Retract.'' ii. 17.)

The case presents the question whether, in the absence of a statute of Congress expressly conferring the right, trial by jury is a necessary incident of judicial procedure in the Philippine Islands, where demand for trial by that method has been made by the accused, and denied by the courts established in the islands.

The recent consideration by this court, and the full discussion had in the opinions delivered in the so-called 'Insular cases,' renders superfluous any attempt to reconsider the constitutional relation of the powers of the government to territory acquired by a treaty cession to the United States.  ''De Lima'' v. ''Bidwell'', [[182 U.S. 1]], 45 L. ed. 1041, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 743; ''Downes'' v. ''Bidwell'', [[182 U.S. 244]], 45 L. ed. 1088, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770. The opinions rendered in those cases cover every phase of the question, either legal or historical, and it would be useless to undertake to add to the elaborate consideration of the subject had therein. In the still more recent case of ''Hawaii'' v. ''Mankichi'', [[190 U.S. 197]], 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787, the right to a jury trial in outlying territory of the United States was under consideration. For the present purpose it is only necessary to state certain conclusions which are deemed to be established by prior adjudications, and are decisive of this case.

It may be regarded as settled that the Constitution of the United States is the only source of power authorizing action by any branch of the Federal government. 'The government of the United States was born of the Constitution, and all powers which it enjoys or may exercise must be either derived expressly or by implication from that instrument.' ''Downes'' v. ''Bidwell'', [[182 U.S. 244]]-288, 45 L. ed. 1088-1106, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, and cases cited. It is equally well settled that the United States may acquire territory in the exercise of the treaty-making power by direct cession as the result of war, and in making effectual the terms of peace; and for that purpose has the powers of other sovereign nations. This principle has been recognized by this court from its earliest decisions. The convention which framed the Constitution of the United States, in view of the territory already possessed and the possibility of acquiring more, inserted in that instrument, in article 4, § 3, a grant of express power to Congress 'to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.'

As early as the February term, 1810, of this court, in the case of ''Sere'' v. ''Pitot'', 6 Cranch, 332, 3 L. ed. 240, Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the opinion of the court, said:

'The power of governing and of legislating for a territory is the inevitable consequence of the right to acquire and to hold territory. Could this position be contested, the Constitution of the United States declares that 'Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.' Accordingly we find Congress possessing and exercising the absolute and undisputed power of governing and legislating for the territory of Orleans. Congress has given them a legislative, an executive, and a judiciary, with such powers as it has been their will to assign to those departments respectively.'

And later, the same eminent judge, delivering the opinion of the court in the leading case upon the subject (''American Ins. Co.'' v. ''356 Bales of Cotton'', 1 Pet. 511, 542, 7 L. ed. 242, 255), says:

'The Constitution confers absolutely on the government of the Union the powers of making war and of making treaties; consequently that government possesses the power of acquiring territory, either by conquest or by treaty.

'The usage of the world is, if a nation be not entirely subdued, to consider the holding of conquered territory as a mere military occupation, until its fate shall be determined at the treaty of peace. If it be ceded by the treaty, the acquisition is confirmed, and the ceded territory becomes a part of the nation to which it is annexed, either on the terms stipulated in the treaty of cession, or on such as its new master shall impose. On such transfer of territory it has never been held that the relations of the inhabitants with each other undergo any change. Their relations with their former sovereign are dissolved, and new relations are created between them and the government which has acquired their territory. The same act which transfers their country transfers the allegiance of those who remain in it; and the law, which may be denominated political, is necessarily changed, although that which regulates the intercourse and general conduct of individuals remains in force until altered by the newly-created power of the state.

'On the 22d of February, 1819, Spain ceded Florida to the United States. The 6th article of the treaty of cession contains the following provision: 'The inhabitants of the territories which His Catholic Majesty cedes the United States by this treaty shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States.' [8 Stat. at L. 256.]

'This treaty is the law of the land, and admits the inhabitants of Florida to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States. It is unnecessary to inquire whether this is not their condition, independent of stipulation. They do not, however, participate in political power; they do not share in the government till Florida shall become a state. In the meantime Florida continues to be a territory of the United States, governed by virtue of that clause in the Constitution which empowers Congress 'to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.&quot;

While these cases, and others which are cited in the late case of ''Downes'' v. ''Bidwell'', [[182 U.S. 244]]-288, 45 L. ed. 1088-1106, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, sustain the right of Congress to make laws for the government of territories, without being subject to all the restrictions which are imposed upon that body when passing laws for the United States, considered as a political body of states in union, the exercise of the power expressly granted to govern the territories is not without limitations. Speaking of this power, Mr. Justice Curtis, in the case of ''Scott'' v. ''Sandford'', 19 How. 614, 15 L. ed. 787, said:

'If, then, this clause does contain a power to legislate respecting the territory, what are the limits of that power?

'To this I answer that, in common with all the other legislative powers of Congress, if finds limits in the express prohibitions on Congress not to do certain things; that, in the exercise of the legislative power, Congress cannot pass an ''ex post facto'' law or bill of attainder; and so in respect to each of the other prohibitions contained in the Constitution.'

In every case where Congress undertakes to legislate in the exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution, the question may arise as to how far the exercise of the power is limited by the 'prohibitions' of that instrument. The limitations which are to be applied in any given case involving territorial government must depend upon the relation of the particular territory to the United States, concerning which Congress is exercising the power conferred by the Constitution. That the United States may have territory which is not incorporated into the United States as a body politic, we think was recognized by the framers of the Constitution in enacting the article already considered, giving power over the territories, and is sanctioned by the opinions of the justices concurring in the judgment in ''Downes'' v. ''Bidwell'', [[182 U.S. 244]]-288, 45 L. ed. 1088-1106, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770.

Until Congress shall see fit to incorporate territory ceded by treaty into the United States, we regard it as settled by that decision that the territory is to be governed under the power existing in Congress to make laws for such territories, and subject to such constitutional restrictions upon the powers of that body as are applicable to the situation.

For this case the practical question is, Must Congress, in establishing a system for trial of crimes and offenses committed in the Philippine Islands, carry to their people by proper affirmative legislation a system of trial by jury?

If the treaty-making power could incorporate territory into the United States without congressional action, it is apparent that the treaty with Spain, ceding the Philippines to the United States [30 Stat. at L. 1759], carefully refrained from so doing; for it is expressly provided that (article 9): 'The civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories hereby ceded to the United States shall be determined by the Congress.' In this language it is clear that it was the intention of the framers of the treaty to reserve to Congress, so far as it could be constitutionally done, a free hand in dealing with these newly-acquired possessions.

The legislation upon the subject shows that not only has Congress hitherto refrained from incorporating the Philippines into the United States, but in the act of 1902, providing for temporary civil government (32 Stat. at L. 691, chap. 1369), there is express provision that § 1891 of the Revised Statutes of 1878 shall not apply to the Philippine Islands. This is the section giving force and effect to the Constitution and laws of the United States, not locally inapplicable, within all the organized territories, and every territory thereafter organized, as elsewhere within the United States.

The requirements of the Constitution as to a jury are found in article 3, § 2:

'The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the states where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.'

And in article 6 of the amendments to the Constitution:

'In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury, of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.'

It was said in the ''Mankichi Case'', [[190 U.S. 197]], 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787, that when the territory had not been incorporated into the United States these requirements were not limitations upon the power of Congress in providing a government for territory in execution of the powers conferred upon Congress. Opinion of Mr. Justice White, p. 220, citing ''Hurtado'' v. ''California'', [[110 U.S. 516]], 28 L. ed. 232, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, 292; ''Re Ross'', [[140 U.S. 453]], 473, 35 L. ed. 581, 589, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 897; ''Bolln'' v. ''Nebraska'', [[176 U.S. 83]], 44 L. ed. 382, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 287, and cases cited on page 86, L. ed. p. 383, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 288; ''Maxwell'' v. ''Dow'', [[176 U.S. 581]], 584, 44 L. ed. 597, 598, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 448, 494; ''Downes'' v. ''Bidwell'', [[182 U.S. 244]], 45 L. ed. 1088, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770.

In the same case Mr. Justice Brown, in the course of his opinion, said:

'We would even go farther, and say that most, if not all, the privileges and immunities contained in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution were intended to apply from the moment of annexation; but we place our decision of this case upon the ground that the two rights alleged to be violated in this case [right to trial by jury and presentment by grand jury] are not fundamental in their nature, but concern merely a method of procedure which sixty years of practice had shown to be suited to the conditions of the islands, and well calculated to conserve the rights of their citizens to their lives, their property, and their well being.'

As we have had occasion to see in the case of ''Kepner'' v. ''United States'', 194 U.S. --, ''ante'', 797, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797, the President, in his instructions to the Philippine Commission, while impressing the necessity of carrying into the new government the guaranties of the Bill of Rights securing those safeguards to life and liberty which are deemed essential to our government, was careful to reserve the right to trial by jury, which was doubtless due to the fact that the civilized portion of the islands had a system of jurisprudence founded upon the civil law, and the uncivilized parts of the archipelago were wholly unfitted to exercise the right of trial by jury. The Spanish system, in force in the Philippines, gave the right to the accused to be tried before judges, who acted in effect as a court of inquiry, and whose judgments were not final until passed in review before the audiencia, or superior court, with right of final review, and power to grant a new trial for errors of law, in the supreme court at Madrid. To this system the Philippine Commission, in executing the power conferred by the orders of the President, and sanctioned by act of Congress (act of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. at L. 691, chap. 1369), has added a guaranty of the right of the accused to be heard by himself and counsel, to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy and public trial, to meet the witnesses against him face to face, and to have compulsory process to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf. And, further, that no person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law, nor be put twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense, nor be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. As appears in the ''Kepner Case'', 194 U.S. --, ''ante'', 797, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797, the accused is given the right of appeal from the judgment of the court of first instance to the supreme court, and, in capital cases, the case goes to the latter court without appeal. It cannot be successfully maintained that this system does not give an adequate and efficient method of protecting the rights of the accused as well as executing the criminal law by judicial proceedings which give full opportunity to be heard by competent tribunals before judgment can be pronounced. Of course, it is a complete answer to this suggestion to say, if such be the fact, that the constitutional requirements as to a jury trial, either of their own force or as limitations upon the power of Congress in setting up a government, must control in all the territory, whether incorporated or not, of the United States. But is this a reasonable interpretation of the power conferred upon Congress to make rules and regulations for the territories?

The cases cited have firmly established the power of the United States, like other sovereign nations, to acquire, by the methods known to civilized peoples, additional territory. The framers of the Constitution, recognizing the possibility of future extension by acquiring territory outside the states, did not leave to implication alone the power to govern and control territory owned or to be acquired, but, in the article quoted, expressly conferred the needful powers to make regulations. Regulations in this sense must mean laws, for, as well as states, territories must be governed by laws. The limitations of this power were suggested by Mr. Justice Curtis in the ''Scott Case'', above quoted, and Mr. Justice Bradley, in the ''Church of Jesus Christ of L. D. S.'' v. ''United States'', [[136 U.S. 1]], 34 L. ed. 481, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 792, said:

'Doubtless Congress, in legislating for the territories, would be subject to those fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights which are formulated in the Constitution and its amendments; but these limitations would exist rather by inference and the general spirit of the Constitution from which Congress derives all its powers, than by any express and direct application of its provisions.'

This language was quoted with approbation by Mr. Justice Brown in ''Downes'' v. ''Bidwell'', [[182 U.S. 244]]-288, 45 L. ed. 1088-1106, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, and in the same case Mr. Justice White said: 'Whilst, therefore, there is no express or implied limitation on Congress in exercising its power to create local governments for any and all of the territories, by which that body is restrained from the widest latitude of discretion, it does not follow that there may not be inherent, although unexpressed, principles which are the basis of all free government, which cannot be with impunity transcended. But this does not suggest that every express limitation of the Constitution which is applicable has not force, but only signifies that even in cases where there is no direct command of the Constitution which applies, there may nevertheless be restrictions of so fundamental a nature that they cannot be transgressed, although not expressed in so many words in the Constitution.'

In treating of article 4, § 3, Judge Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Law, says:

'The peculiar wording of the provision [§ 3, article 4] has led some persons to suppose that it was intended Congress should exercise, in respect to the territory, the rights only of a proprietor of property, and that the people of the territories were to be left at liberty to institute governments for themselves. It is no doubt most consistent with the general theory of republican institutions that the people everywhere should be allowed self-government; but it has never been deemed a matter of right that a local community should be suffered to lay the foundations of institutions, and erect a structure of government thereon, without the guidance and restraint of a superior authority. Even in the older states, where society is most homogeneous and has fewest of the elements of disquiet and disorder, the state reserves to itself the right to shape municipal institutions; and towns and cities are only formed under its directions, and according to the rules and within the limits the state prescribes. With still less reason could the settlers in new territories be suffered to exercise sovereign powers. The practice of the government, originating before the adoption of the Constitution, has been for Congress to establish governments for the territories; and whether the jurisdiction over the district has been acquired by grant from the states, or by treaty with a foreign power, Congress has unquestionably full power to govern it; and the people, except as Congress shall provide for, are not of right entitled to participate in political authority until the territory becomes a state. Meantime they are in a condition of temporary pupilage and dependence; and while Congress will be expected to recognize the principle of self-government to such extent as may seem wise, its discretion alone can constitute the measure by which the participation of the people can be determined.' Cooley, Principles of Const. Law, 164.

If the right to trial by jury were a fundamental right which goes wherever the jurisdiction of the United States extends, or if Congress, in framing laws for outlying territory belonging to the United States, was obliged to establish that system by affirmative legislation, it would follow that, no matter what the needs or capacities of the people, trial by jury, and in no other way, must be forthwith established, although the result may be to work injustice and provoke disturbance rather than to aid the orderly administration of justice. If the United States, impelled by its duty or advantage, shall acquire territory people by savages, and of which it may dispose or not hold for ultimate admission to statehood, if this doctrine is sound, it must establish there the trial by jury. To state such a proposition demonstrates the impossibility of carrying it into practice. Again, if the United States shall acquire by treaty the cession of territory having an established system of jurisprudence, where jury trials are unknown, but a method of fair and orderly trial prevails under an acceptable and long-established code, the preference of the people must be disregarded, their established customs ignored, and they themselves coerced to accept, in advance of incorporation into the United States, a system of trial unknown to them and unsuited to their needs. We do not think it was intended, in giving power to Congress to make regulations for the territories, to hamper its exercise with this condition.

We conclude that the power to govern territory, implied in the right to acquire it, and given to Congress in the Constitution in article 4, § 3, to whatever other limitations it may be subject, the extent of which must be decided as questions arise, does not require that body to enact for ceded territory not made a part of the United States by Congressional action, a system of laws which shall include the right of trial by jury, and that the Constitution does not, without legislation, and of its own force, carry such right to territory so situated.

Other assignments of error bring further questions before the court which we will proceed to notice. The case was a prosecution for libel, brought at the instance of Don Benito Legarda, a member of the Philippine Commission, against the plaintiffs in error, Dorr and O'Brien, who were proprietors and editors of a newspaper published in the city of Manila known as the 'Manila Freedom.' It appears that Legarda was the prosecuting witness against one Valdez, editor of a certain Spanish newspaper called the 'Miau.' At the time of the trial of Valdez, under the Spanish law then in force in the islands, the truth could not be given in defense in a prosecution for criminal libel. Notwithstanding this fact, counsel for Valdez, in the form of an offer of proof, read a paper in court, making certain statements with reference to the libel charged, tending to show the truth thereof. In what purported to be a report of the proceeding, the Manila Freedom printed an article containing the matter set forth in the offer to prove, with headlines in large type, as follows:

'TRAITOR, SEDUCER, AND PERJURER.

SENSATIONAL ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COMMISSIONER LEGARDA.

MADE OF RECORD AND READ IN ENGLISH-SPANISH READING WAIVED.

Wife would have killed him.

Legarda pale and nervous.'

The prosecution of the plaintiffs in error was based upon the publication of these headlines, which were charged to be a false and malicious libel, printed in the English language, of and concerning Don Benito Legarda. At the time Valdez was tried, in which case the occurrence undertaken to be reported took place, the Spanish law was in force, denying the right to put in evidence the truth of the alleged libelous matter. At the time of the trial of the plaintiffs in error the Philippine Commission had passed act No. 277, known as the libel law:

[No. 277.]

'An Act Defining the Law of Libel and Threats to Publish a Libel, Making Libel and Threats to Publish Libel Misdemeanors, Giving a Right of Civil Action Therefor, and Making Obscene or Indecent Publications Misdemeanors.

'''By authority of the President of the United States, be it enacted by the United States Philippine Commission that:'' Sec. 1. A libel is a malicious defamation, expressed either in writing, printing, or by signs or pictures, or the like, or public theatrical exhibitions, tending to blacken the memory of one who is dead or to impeach the honesty, virtue, or reputation, or publish the alleged or natural defects of one who is alive, and thereby expose him to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'Sec. 4. In all criminal prosecutions for libel the truth may be given in evidence to the court, and if it appears to the court that the matter charged as libelous is true, and was published with good motives, and for justifiable ends, the party shall be acquitted; otherwise he shall be convicted; but to establish this defense, not only must the truth of the matter so charged be proven, but also that it was published with good motives and for justifiable ends.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'Sec. 6. Every author, editor, or proprietor of any book, newspaper, or serial publication is chargeable with the publication of any words contained in any part of such book or number of each newspaper or serial, as fully as if he were the author of the same.

'Sec. 7. No reporter, editor, or proprietor of any newspaper is liable to any prosecution for a fair and true report of any judicial, legislative, or other public official proceedings, or of any statement, speech, argument, or debate in the course of the same, except upon proof of malice in making such report, which shall not be implied from the mere fact of publication.

'Sec. 8. Libelous remarks or comments connected with matter privileged by the last section receive no privilege by reason of being so connected.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'Enacted October 24, 1901.'

The contention is that the publication is privileged under §§ 7 and 8, the claim being that the publication was a fair and truthful report of judicial proceedings. Testimony was introduced in the court below tending to show malice, and there was no proof to support the truth of the charges in the alleged libel, which were found to be without basis and wanton, and as the findings of the two lower courts in a case brought in review here are not ordinarily disturbed, the case upon this branch might rest upon that proposition. It is evident, however, that the publication in question did not stop with a simple report of the judicial proceedings. Indeed, the paper offered in evidence could not have been received under the law then in force,-a fact concerning which no comment was made in the report of the proceedings. Furthermore, § 8 of the law, while permitting, as privileged, a fair and truthful report of judicial proceedings, except upon express proof of malice, does not make privileged libelous remarks or comments in connection with the privileged matter. The draftsman of the law evidently had in mind the law of criminal libel in newspaper publications as it exists in this country. The privilege extends to a full and correct report of judicial proceedings without prejudicial comment. The rule is nowhere better stated than by Judge Cooley in his work on Constitutional Limitations, 7th ed., p. 637: 'It seems to be settled that a fair and impartial account of judicial proceedings, which have not been ''ex parte'', but in the hearing of both parties, is, generally speaking, a justifiable publication. But it is said that if a party is to be allowed to publish what passes in a court of justice, he must publish the whole case, and not merely state the conclusion which he himself draws from the evidence. A plea that the supposed libel was, in substance, a true account and report of a trial, has been held bad; and a statement of the circumstances of a trial as from counsel in the case has been held not privileged. The report must also be strictly confined to the actual proceedings in court, and must contain no defamatory observations or comments from any quarter whatsoever, in addition to what forms strictly and properly the legal proceedings.'

Many cases are cited by the learned author in support of this conclusion. In ''Hayes'' v. ''Press Co.'' 127 Pa. 642, 5 L. R. A. 643, 14 Am. St. Rep. 874, 18 Atl. 331, headlines stating 'Hotel Proprietors Embarrassed,' in giving an account of a judgment rendered in the suit of a bank against the proprietors of a certain hotel, was held not privileged. In Newell on Defamation, Slander and Libel, chap. 19, § 163, the author says:

'The publisher must add nothing of his own. He must not state his opinion of the conduct of the parties, or impute motives therefor; he must not insinuate that a particular witness committed perjury. That is not a report of what occurred; it is simply his comment on what occurred, and to this no privilege attaches. Often such comments may be justified on another ground, that they are fair and bona fide criticism on a matter of public interest, and are therefore not libelous. But such observations, to which quite different considerations apply, should not be mixed up with the history of the case. Lord Campbell said: 'If any comments are made, they should not be made as part of the report. The report should be confined to what takes place in court; and the two things-report and comment-should be kept separate.' And all sensational headings to reports should be avoided.' ''Thomas'' v. ''Croswell'', 7 Johns. 264, 5 Am. Dec. 269.

These headlines were not privileged matter at the common law, and were libelous remarks or comments if the matter could be deemed otherwise privileged, within the meaning of § 8 of the Philippine libel law. An inspection of them would seem to be sufficient to demonstrate this fact. The complainant was held up to the public where the paper circulated in striking headlines as 'Traitor, Seducer, Perjurer,' and while these words were quoted, as well as the phrase 'Wife would have killed him,' their publication in this manner was certainly the equivalent to a remark or comment unnecessary to a fair and truthful report of judicial proceedings, and likely to raise inferences highly detrimental to the character and standing of the one concerning whom they were printed and published.

Further error is assigned in that act No. 277 of the laws of the Philippine Commission was not passed by competent legal authority. The act was one of the laws of the Philippine Commission, passed by that body by virtue of the authority given the President under the so-called Spooner resolution of March 2, 1901 [31 Stat. at L. 910, chap. 803]. The right of Congress to authorize a temporary government of this character is not open to question at this day. The power has been frequently exercised and is too well settled to require further discussion. ''De Lima'' v. ''Bidwell'', [[182 U.S. 1]], 196, 45 L. ed. 1041, 1056, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 743.

''Judgment affirmed''.

I concur in the result of the opinion of the court in this case, which upholds the conviction of the plaintiffs in error on a trial at Manila, Philippine Islands, for a criminal offense, without a jury. I do so simply because of the decision in ''Hawaii'' v. ''Mankichi'', [[190 U.S. 197]], 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787. That case was decided by the concurring views of a majority of this court, and although I did not and do not concur in those views, yet the case in my opinion is authority for the result arrived at in the case now before us, to wit, that a jury trial is not a constitutional necessity in a criminal case in Hawaii or in the Philippine Islands. But, while concurring in this judgment, I do not wish to be understood as assenting to the view that ''Downes'' v. ''Bidwell'', [[182 U.S. 244]], 45 L. ed. 1088, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, is to be regarded as authority for the decision herein. That case is authority only for the proposition that the plaintiff therein was not entitled to recover the amount of duties he had paid under protest upon the importation into the city of New York of certain oranges from the port of San Juan, in the Island of Porto Rico, in November, 1900, after the passage of the act known as the Foraker act [31 Stat. at L. 77, chap. 191]. The various reasons advanced by the judges in reaching this conclusion, which were not concurred in by a majority of the court, are plainly not binding. The ''Mankichi Case'' is, however, directly in point, and calls for an affirmance of this judgment.

I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice Brewer agree in this concurring opinion.

I do not believe now any more than I did when ''Hawaii'' v. ''Mankichi'', [[190 U.S. 197]], 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787, was decided, that the provisions of the Federal Constitution as to grand and petit juries relate to mere methods of procedure, and are not fundamental in their nature. In my opinion, guaranties for the protection of life, liberty, and property, as embodied in the Constitution, are for the benefit of all, of whatever race or nativity, in the states composing the Union, or in any territory, however acquired, over the inhabitants of which the government of the United States may exercise the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution.

The Constitution declares that ''no'' person, except in the land or naval forces, shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, except on the presentment or indictment of a grand jury; and forbids the conviction, in a criminal prosecution, of any person, for any crime, except on the unanimous verdict of a petit jury composed of twelve persons. Necessarily, that mandate was addressed to every one committing crime punishable by the United States. This court, however, holds that these provisions are not fundamental, and may be disregarded in any territory acquired in the manner the Philippine Islands were acquired, although, as heretofore decided by this court, they could not be disregarded in what are commonly called the organized territories of the United States. ''Thompson'' v. ''Utah'', [[170 U.S. 343]], 42 L. ed. 1061, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 620. I cannot assent to this interpretation of the Constitution. It is, I submit, so obviously inconsistent with the Constitution that I cannot regard the judgment of the court otherwise than as an amendment of that instrument by judicial construction, when a different mode of amendment is expressly provided for. Grand juries and petit juries may be, at times, somewhat inconvenient in the administration of criminal justice in the Philippines. But such inconveniences are of slight consequence compared with the dangers to our system of government arising from judicial amendments of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that it 'shall be the supreme law of the land.' But the court in effect adjudges that the Philippine Islands are not part of the 'land,' within the meaning of the Constitution, although they are governed by the sovereign authority of the United States, and although their inhabitants are subject in all respects to its jurisdiction,-as much so as are the people in the District of Columbia or in the several states of the Union. No power exists in the judiciary to suspend the operation of the Constitution in any territory governed, as to its affairs and people, by authority of the United States. As a Filipino committing the crime of murder in the Philippine Islands may be hung by the sovereign authority of the United States, and as the Philippine Islands are under a civil, not military, government, the suggestion that he may not, of right, appeal for his protection to the jury provisions of the Constitution, which constitutes the only source of the power that the government may exercise at any time or at any place, is utterly revolting to my mind, and can never receive my sanction. The Constitution, without excepting from its provisions any persons over whom the United States may exercise jurisdiction, declares expressly that 'the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury.' It is now adjudged that that provision is not fundamental in respect of a part of the people over whom the United States may exercise full legislative, judicial and executive power. Indeed, it is adjudged, in effect, that the above clause, in its application to this case, is to be construed as if it read: 'The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, ''and except where Filipinos are concerned'', shall be by jury.' Such a mode of constitutional interpretation plays havoc with the old-fashioned ideas of the fathers, who took care to say that the Constitution was the supreme law,-supreme everywhere, at all times, and over all persons who are subject to the authority of the United States. According to the principles of the opinion just rendered, neither the governor nor any American civil officer in the Philippines, although citizens of the United States, although under an oath to support the Constitution, and although in those distant possessions for the purpose of enforcing the authority of the United States, can claim, of right, the benefit of the jury provisions of the Constitution, if tried for crime committed on those Islands. Besides there are many thousands of American soldiers in the Philippines. They are there by command of the United States, to enforce its authority. They carry the flag of the United States, and have not lost their American citizenship. Yet, if charged in the Philippines with having committed a crime against the United States of which a civil tribunal may take cognizance, they cannot, under the present decision, claim of right a trial by jury. So that, if an American soldier, in discharge of his duty to his country, goes into what some call our 'outlying dependencies,' he is, it seems, 'outside of the Constitution,' in respect of a right which this court has said was justly 'dear to the American people,' and has 'always been an object of deep interest and solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has been watched with great jealousy;' a right which, Mr. Justice Story said, was, from very early times, insisted on by our ancestors in the parent country 'as the great bulwark of their civil and political liberties.' ''Parsons'' v. ''Bedford'', 3 Pet. 433, 436, 7 L. ed. 732, 733; 2 Story, Const. § 1779. Referring to the declaration by a French writer, that Rome, Sparta, and Carthage having lost their liberties, those of England must in time perish, Blackstone observed that the writer 'should have recollected that Rome, Sparta, and Carthage, at the time their liberties were lost, were strangers to the trial by jury.' 2 Bl. Com. 379.

In a former case I had occasion to say, and I still think, that 'neither the life, nor the liberty, nor the property of ''any'' person, within any territory or country over which the United States is sovereign, can be taken, under the sanction of any civil tribunal, acting under its authority, by any form of procedure inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States;' that 'the Constitution is the supreme law in every territory, as soon as it comes under the sovereign dominion of the United States for purposes of civil administration, and whose inhabitants are under its entire authority and jurisdiction.' [Hawaii v. ''Mankichi'', [[190 U.S. 197]], 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787.]

My views as to the scope and meaning of the provisions of the Constitution which relate to grand and petit juries, and as to the relations of the United States to our newly acquired possessions, have been more fully stated in cases heretofore decided in this court,  and I have therefore not deemed it

Hurtado v. California, [[110 U.S. 516]], 538, 28 L. ed. 232, 239, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, 292; Thompson v. Utah, [[170 U.S. 343]], 42 L. ed. 1061, 18 Sup. Ct. rep. 620; Maxwell v. Dow, [[176 U.S. 581]], 605, 44 L. ed. 597, 606 20 sup. Ct. Rep. 448, 494; Downes v. Bidwell, [[182 U.S. 244]], 375, 45 L. ed. 1088, 1140, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770; Hawaii v. Mankichi, [[190 U.S. 197]], 221, 226, 47 L. ed. 1016, 1024, 1026, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787. necessary, in the present case, to enter upon a review of the authorities.

I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.

APPEAL from the Court of Claims.

Dorsheimer, collector of internal revenue at Buffalo, New York, and two others, informers in the case, filed a petition in the Court of Claims to recover from the United States one-half of $220,102, which the government received on a compromise with Sturges &amp; Sons, of a prosecution against property of one Rhomberg, a distiller.

The case was this:

The act of June 3, 1864, 'to provide internal revenue,' enacts, that any distiller who shall fail to make true entry and report of his stills, liquors, &amp;c., shall forfeit all the liquors made, and all the vessels, stills, &amp;c., and personal property on the premises, &amp;c.; and that these may be seized by any collector, and held by him until a decision thereon according to law. {{ref|1}} And by its 179th section gives authority to collectors to prosecute for the recovery of fines, penalties, and forfeitures, in the name of the United States; and confers the right to one moiety of them upon 'the collector or deputy collector' who shall first 'inform of the cause, matter, or thing, whereby such penalty may have been incurred.' {{ref|2}}

The amendment to this section in the act of March 3, 1865, {{ref|3}} gives this to any person who shall first inform, and adds, that when 'the penalty is paid ''without suit, or before judgment'', and a moiety is claimed by any person as informer, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any claimant is entitled to such moiety, and to whom it shall be piad.' An early act-one of March 3, 1797 {{ref|4}}-confers authority on the Secretary of the Treasury to mitigate or remit any fine, forfeiture, or penalty, incurred by any vessel, goods, or wares, by force of the laws for laying, levying, or collecting any duties or taxes, which, ''in his'' opinion, shall have been incurred without wilful negligence, or any intention of fraud in the person or persons incurring the same.

With these acts in force, Rhomberg, a distiller at Dubuque, Iowa, violated the laws by making false returns, and fraudulently withholding taxes to the amount of $195,000. Upon information furnished by Dorsheimer and the two other persons, his liquors, distilling apparatus, grain, and the cattle at the distillery, were seized, and proceedings for their forfeiture instituted in the several districts of New York, Illinois, and Iowa, where the seizures were made.

After the seizure, Sturges &amp; Sons, of Chicago, intervened, asserting that, without the least knowledge of Rhomberg's fraud, they had made very large advances on the property seized. And they paid to the United States $33,946, ''on confession, by Rhomberg, that that amount of taxes had been withheld by him''.

The government, however, still holding on to the property seized, and the suits being in existence, Sturges &amp; Sons entered into negotiations with the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue, who accordingly released the spirits seized, and dismissed the proceedings, excepting in Iowa, taking, in place of them, the bond of Sturges &amp; Sons for $275,000, conditioned,

That, if it should be determined by the commissioner that the said spirits are not subject to the lien of the government for revenue duties, as against the advances made by the said firm, or if the obligors shall pay such sum of money as the commissioner should determine to be due the government for said property seized, then the obligation to be void; it being understood that the obligors are not liable, under the bond, for any penalty which the government may assess against Rhomberg, but only shall be liable for the actual amount of duties found to be unpaid, together with proper costs and charges attending the investigation of the case and seizure of the property.

In the meanwhile the United States continued its prosecution against the distillery, and to prevent the loss which would occur by stopping it, the officers in charge proceeded to use up the raw materials on hand which had been seized, and, in so doing, produced liquors valued at $150,000; the money (about $54,814) required to pay the expenses of so running the distillery, being furnished by Sturges &amp; Sons.

After various negotiations-Rhomberg's fraud standing confessed on the records of the Treasury-the Secretary of the Treasury compromised with Sturges &amp; Sons, thus:

He relinquished to them the distillery and the appurtenances, and also the product of the distillery, namely, the $150,000 worth of liquor, free of tax, and also the moneys received at Dubuque, $54,814; also, the proceeds of the cattle which had been sold, and the liquors seized, with the claim of the United States for forfeiture. The government also surrendered the bond for $275,000, given by Sturges &amp; Sons, and assigned to them a bond given by Rhomberg to the United States. The government, on its part, received $220,102, 'which amount the Secretary of the Treasury stated to be composed as follows:'

Deficiency of taxes,............. $195,102

In lieu of penalties and forfeitures,. 25,000



$220,102

This compromise was made in face of a protest of Dorsheimer and his co-informers, against any settlement which should make a distinction between the share to be paid to the government and the share to be paid to them. The secretary professed to make it under the 44th section of the act of 30th June, 1864, which gives him power to '''compromise''' all suits 'relating to the internal revenue.'

The compromise being made, Dorsheimer and his co-informers claimed from the secretary one-half of the $220,102 received. The secretary refused to pay them the half of ''that'' sum, but was willing to pay them half of the $25,000, this last sum being, as he considered, all that was received in lieu of penalties and forfeiture. Dorsheimer and his co-informers accordingly filed their petition in the Court of Claims, setting forth the facts of the case as above, and claiming the half of the $220,102. The United States demurred, and the demurrer-after argument, in which ''The United States'' v. ''Morris'', reported in 10th Wheaton, 246, was relied on to support it,-being sustained, and the petition dismissed, the case was brought here by the informers on appeal.


''Messrs. Dorsheimer and Dick (with whom was Mr. M. Blair), for the appellants:''


Invited by statutes relating to the internal revenue, the petitioners below undertook the services mentioned in this case. They thus became employed by the government, and rights accrued to them for their services. When suit was instituted, it was instituted upon a forfeiture given by law; a forfeiture as from the date of the offence committed; and this forfeiture was a 'statutory transfer of right.' {{ref|5}} The right was to the joint use of the government and the informers, and so continued until the final settlement was made. {{ref|6}} The interest of an informer is a matter of contract, and a right of property, though, until decree, but an inchoate right, vests; a right which the government cannot affect. {{ref|7}} No doubt the secretary may remit, in virtue of pre-existing statutes; but this power, says this court in ''The Gray Jacket'', {{ref|8}} 'is defined and limited by law.' The jurisdiction is a special one, and, if transcended, the secretary's act is void.

The compromise could not be sustained at all on the act of 1797, which gives authority to remit or mitigate only on the ground of innocence. Here the guilt was confessed. And the secretary here made no voluntary or gratuitous surrender of any of the joint rights and claims. On the contrary, he made the most out of them that could be made.

Neither can the secretary, under the power given in the act of 1864 to 'compromise,' ''so'' compromise as to destroy the rights of the informers, in the way which he would here seek to do. The secretary stood in the place of the parties interested in the suit, parties who had a joint interest. He had no power, under any proceeding, however named, to divide the interest of the government from that of the officers; nor to settle the controversy upon terms which would make the result of what he did enure to the advantage of one and not of the other. His power extended no further than to agree with the ''opposing'' claimant, on the division between ''him'', such claimant, and the parties represented by the secretary, of the property seized, and what the opposing claimant relinquished belonged to the parties to the suit; belonging to them not ''de novo'', but by means of the previously existing title. A compromise is a common end of a suit, well known to the law, and yields fruits which are as thoroughly the avails of the suit as would be those given by a writ of execution. And, indeed, as this mode of terminating these suits is prescribed by the act under consideration, it may be well considered as in the category of process of law for the enforcement of claims under the statute.

''The United States'' v. ''Morris'' {{ref|9}} decides nothing more than that the anthority to remit the forfeiture is not limited to the period before condemnation or judgment, but that 'the authority to remit is limited only by the payment of the money to the collector for distribution.' So the court says: 'If the government refuse to adopt the informer's acts, or waive the forfeiture, there is an end to his claim; he cannot proceed to enforce that which the government repudiates.' Whence it is inferable that if the government ''did adopt'' his acts, and did ''not'' waive the forfeiture, but, on the contrary, reaped a great benefit from them, that then the informer would be entitled to recover his share of that which the government received by and through the adoption of his acts, and the proceedings upon his information.

In the case now at bar, there was an action instituted by the government upon and as the direct consequence of the collector's proceedings. The only question is whether the money received was the fruit of the action. Clearly it was; for through the proceedings of the collector the government received a large sum; without them it would have received nothing.

The taxes, so called, were not paid by or on behalf of Rhomberg, and no one else was liable for them. No receipt for taxes was given to any one, nor were Rhomberg's interests considered at all in the settlement. The purchasers of the property from him were negotiating with the United States for a confirmation of their title, and asked for and got a sale, transfer, and delivery of the property, clothed with the title which the government had acquired. Sturges &amp; Sons considered the case theirs. Rhomberg was out of the question. The forfeitures by his frauds, standing confessed, had extinguished him.

There is no doubt but that the claimants would have been entitled to the moiety of this sum of $195,102, if the secretary had not called it by the name of taxes. The compromise was simply that the owners paid $220,102, and received back their property, worth $350,000, with a discontinuance of the suit. But the secretary determines within his own mind-''in petto''-that this sum of $220,102 shall be composed of certain elements; a composition wholly imaginary; and that the compromise should consist in his receiving a sum equal to the taxes on a part of the property, and another sum, fixed arbitrarily, which he called the forfeiture. If, after the money had been paid, he had reconsidered his determination, and called the $195,102 forfeiture instead of taxes, the claimants would have been entitled to one-half of this, and the defendant in the other suit would have been neither injured nor affected; and if, on the contrary, he had reconsidered his determination, and called the $25,000 taxes on some other portion of the property relinquished, the claimants would have been entitled to nothing, and the defendant in the other suit would have been neither benefited nor affected. Now, has the secretary, under a power to 'compromise a suit,' not only a power to compromise the suit, but an absolute right of distribution over the proceeds? We conceive that the government had a controlling right to abandon the adventure, but we submit that it had no right to remit its partner's share and retain its own.

In conclusion: The claims of the informers are maintained by the general policy of the United States; which is, that whenever the government adopts the acts of the informer, and proceeds upon his discoveries and to his risk, it will share equally with him whatever may be received through his proceedings; a policy which has never been departed from since the establishment of the government, has been clearly indicated by its statutes, and repeatedly maintained by this court.


''Mr. Talbot, contra:''


The only question is, whether the $195,102 was penalty.

The Secretary of the Treasury states that it was not received as penalty. And beyond the statement of this officer, this court will make no inquiry. That statement will be deemed sufficient to sustain the demurrer.

But if the court look into the admitted case, it corroborates this representation of the secretary.

There was a confessed deficiency of $195,000 taxes, and $33,946 was paid soon after the seizure, upon a confession of so much deficiency of taxes. The bond given by Sturges &amp; Sons was to secure payment of unpaid taxes.

To these statements of fact it is no answer to say even that the action of the secretary was not authorized by law. Whether brought about lawfully or otherwise, the result, namely, the non-payment of the sum of $195,102, or of any part thereof, as penalty, takes away the foundation of this claim. For this is a claim not for damages, because the Secretary of the Treasury has unlawfully prevented a moiety from accruing to the appellants, but for a moiety which they allege did accrue. Nor does it avail the appellants that what was received ought to have been received as penalty. It is enough in support of the demurrer to show that, in fact, it was not paid and received as penalty.

Further. The act of the secretary in discontinuing these proceedings upon full payment of the taxes withheld, and of $25,000 in lieu of fines and penalties, was within the scope of authority conferred by the 44th section of the act of 1864, to compromise all 'suits relating to internal revenue.'

Mr. Justice GRIER delivered the opinion of the court, and having quoted the act of March 3d, 1797, and the 179th section of that of June 3d, 1864, as amended in the act of March 3d, 1865, all as already given in the statement of the case, {{ref|10}} proceeded as follows:

The purpose of penalties inflicted upon persons who attempt to defraud the revenue, is to enforce the collection of duties and taxes. They act ''in terrorem'' upon parties whose conscientious scruples are not sufficient to balance their hopes of profit. The offer of a portion of such penalties to the collectors is to stimulate and reward their zeal and industry in detecting fraudulent attempts to evade the payment of duties and taxes.

As the great object of the act 'to provide internal revenue' is to collect the tax, the Secretary of the Treasury has no power to remit ''it''. When the primary object of collecting the tax is obtained, as in the present case, the further infliction of penalties is submitted entirely to the discretion of the secretary. No discretion is given to the courts to act in the case further than to give their judgment; and if the penalties are not mitigated or remitted by the secretary, either before or after judgment, to enforce them by proper process.

The subject has been carefully examined by this court in the case of ''United States'' v. ''Morris'', {{ref|11}} where it is decided 'that the Secretary of the Treasury has authority, under the remission act of March 3d, 1797, to remit a forfeiture or penalty accruing under the revenue laws at any time, ''before or after judgment'', for the penalty, until the money is actually paid over to the collector,' and that 'such remission extends to the shares of the forfeiture or penalty to which the officers of the customs are entitled, as well as to the interests of the United States.'

The court say that, 'It is not denied but that the customhouse officers have an inchoate interest upon the seizure; and it is admitted that this may be defeated by a remission at any time ''before'' condemnation. If their interest before condemnation is conditional, and subject to the power of remission, the judgment of condemnation can have no other effect than to fix and determine that interest as against the claimant. These officers, although they may be considered parties in interest, are not parties on the record, and it cannot be said with propriety, that they have a vested right in the sense in which the law considers such rights. Their interest is still conditional, and the condemnation only ascertains and determines the fact on which the right is consummated, should no remission take place.' The right does not become fixed until the receipt of the money by the collector.

If these well-settled principles be applied to the case before us, its solution is easy.

It was the first duty of the collector to collect the amount of duties or taxes on the property seized. The secretary had no right to mitigate, remit, or compromise that amount. Persons who had advanced money on the property in good faith offer the whole amount of the tax due, and finally agreed to pay the sum of $25,000 to have the penalties remitted. This offer was accepted, and the further prosecution of the suits was consequently ended.

The power intrusted by law to the secretary was not a judicial one, but one of ''mercy'', to mitigate the severity of the law. It admitted of no appeal to the Court of Claims, or to any other court. It was the exercise of his discretion in a matter intrusted to him alone, and from which there could be no appeal. Even if we were called upon to review the acts of the secretary, we see no reason to doubt their correctness, or that of the judgment of the Court of Claims in dismissing the case.

DECREE AFFIRMED.

The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice NELSON dissented.

THE apple trees are hung with gold,&lt;br /&gt;
And birds are loud in Arcady,&lt;br /&gt;
The sheep lie bleating in the fold,&lt;br /&gt;
The wild goat runs across the wold,&lt;br /&gt;
But yesterday his love he told,&lt;br /&gt;
I know he will come back to me.&lt;br /&gt;
O rising moon! O Lady moon!&lt;br /&gt;
Be you my lover's sentinel,&lt;br /&gt;
You cannot choose but know him well,&lt;br /&gt;
For he is shod with purple shoon,&lt;br /&gt;
You cannot choose but know my love,&lt;br /&gt;
For he a shepherd's crook doth bear,&lt;br /&gt;
And he is soft as any dove,&lt;br /&gt;
And brown and curly is his hair.


The turtle now has ceased to call&lt;br /&gt;
Upon her crimson-footed groom,&lt;br /&gt;
The grey wolf prowls about the stall,&lt;br /&gt;
The lily's singing seneschal&lt;br /&gt;
Sleeps in the lily-bell, and all&lt;br /&gt;
The violet hills are lost in gloom.&lt;br /&gt;
O risen moon! O holy moon!&lt;br /&gt;
Stand on the top of Helice,&lt;br /&gt;
And if my own true love you see,&lt;br /&gt;
Ah! if you see the purple shoon,&lt;br /&gt;
The hazel crook, the lad's brown hair,&lt;br /&gt;
The goat-skin wrapped about his arm,&lt;br /&gt;
Tell him that I am waiting where&lt;br /&gt;
The rushlight glimmers in the Farm.


The falling dew is cold and chill,&lt;br /&gt;
And no bird sings in Arcady,


The little fauns have left the hill,&lt;br /&gt;
Even the tired daffodil&lt;br /&gt;
Has closed its gilded doors, and still&lt;br /&gt;
My lover comes not back to me.&lt;br /&gt;
False moon! False moon! O waning moon!&lt;br /&gt;
Where is my own true lover gone,&lt;br /&gt;
Where are the lips vermilion,&lt;br /&gt;
The shepherd's crook, the purple shoon?&lt;br /&gt;
Why spread that silver pavilion,&lt;br /&gt;
Why wear that veil of drifting mist?&lt;br /&gt;
Ah! thou hast young Endymion,&lt;br /&gt;
Thou hast the lips that should be kissed!

Frederic, by the grace of God, the august emperor of the Romans, king of Jerusalem and Sicily, to his well-beloved friend, Henry, king of the English, health and sincere affection.

Let all rejoice and exult in the Lord, and let those who are correct in heart glorify Him, who, to make known His power, does, not make boast of horses and chariots, but has now gained glory for Himself, in the scarcity of His soldiers, that all may know and understand that He is glorious in His majesty, terrible in His, magnificence, and wonderful in His plans on the sons of men, changing seasons at will, and bringing the hearts of different nations together; for in these few days, by a miracle rather than by strength' that business has been brought to a conclusion, which for a length of time past many chiefs and rulers of the world amongst the multitude of nations, have never been able till now to accomplish by force, however great, nor by fear.

Not, therefore, to keep you in suspense by a long account, we wish to inform your holiness, that we, firmly putting our trust in God, and believing that Jesus Christ, His Son, in whose service we have so devotedly exposed our bodies and lives, would not abandon us in these unknown and distant countries, but would at least give us wholesome advice and assistance for His honor,, praise, and glory, boldly in the name set forth from Acre on the fifteenth day of the month of November last past and arrived safely at Joppa, intending to rebuild the castle at that place with proper strength, that afterwards the approach to the holy city of, Jerusalem might be not only easier, but also shorter and more safe for us as well as for all Christians. When, therefore we were, in the confidence of our trust in God, engaged at Joppa, and superintending the building of the castle and the cause of Christ, as necessity required and as was our duty, and whilst all our pilgrims were busily engaged in these matters, several messengers often passed to and fro between us and the sultan of Babylon; for he and another sultan, called Xaphat, his brother were with a large army at the city of Gaza, distant about one day's journey from us; in another direction, in the city of Sichen, which is commonly called Neapolis, and situated in the plains,the sultan of Damascus' his nephew, was staying with an immense number of knights and soldiers also about a day's journey from us and the Christians.

And whilst the treaty was in progress between the parties on either side of the restoration of the Holy Land, at length Jesus Christ, the Son of God, beholding from on high our devoted endurance and patient devotion to His cause, in His merciful compassion of us, at length brought it about that the sultan of Babylon restored to us the holy city, the place where the feet of Christ trod, and where the true worshippers adore the Father in spirit and in truth. But that we may inform you of the particulars of this surrender each as they happened, be it known to you that not only is the body of the aforesaid city restored to us, but also the whole of the country extending from thence to the sea­coast near the castle of Joppa, so that for the future pilgrims will have free passage and a safe return to and from the sepulchre; provided, however, that the Saracens of that part of the country, since they hold the temple in great veneration, may come there as often as they choose in the character of pilgrims, to worship according to their custom, and that we shall henceforth permit them to come, however, only as many as we may choose to allow, and without arms, nor are they to dwell in the city, but outside, and as soon as they have paid their devotions they are to depart.

Moreover, the city of Bethlehem is restored to us, and all the country between Jerusalem and that city; as also the city of Nazareth, and all the country between Acre and that city; the whole of the district of Turon, which is very extensive, and very advantageous to the Christians; the city of Sidon, too, is given up to us with the whole plain and its appurtenances, which will be the more acceptable to the Christians the more advantageous it has till now appeared to be to the Saracens, especially as there is a good harbor there, and from there great quantities of arms and necessaries might be carried to the city of Damascus' and often from Damascus to Babylon. And although according to our treaty we are allowed to rebuild the city of Jerusalem in as good a state as it has ever been, and also the castles of Joppa, Cesarea, Sidon, and that of St. Mary of the Teutonic order, which the brothers of that order have begun to build in the mountainous district of Acre, and which it has never been allowed the Christians to do during any former truce; nevertheless the sultan is not allowed, till the end of the truce between him and us, which is agreed on for ten years, to repair or rebuild any fortres or castles.&lt;ref&gt;The treaty's terms are described differently in Ryccardus de Sancto Germano&lt;/ref&gt;

And so on Sunday, the eighteenth day of February last pastm which is the day on which Christ, the Son of God, rose from dead, and which, in memory of His resurrection, is solemnly cherished and kept holy by all Christians in general throughout the world, this treaty of peace was confirmed by oath between us. Truly then on us and on all does that day seem to have shone favorably, in which the angels sing in praise of God, &quot; Glory to God on high, and on earth peace, and good­will toward men.&quot; And in acknowledgment of such great kindness and of such an honor, which, beyond our deserts and contrary to the opinion of many, God has mercifully conferred on us, to the lasting renown of His compassion, and that in His holy place we might personally offer to Him the burnt offering of our lips, be it known to you that on the seventeenth day of the month of March of this second indiction, we, in company with all the pilgrims who had with us faithfully followed Christ, the Son of God, entered the holy city of Jerusalem, and after worshipping at the holy sepulchre, we, as being a Catholic emperor, on the following day, wore the crown, which Almighty God provided for us from the throne of His majesty, when of His especial grace, He exalted us on high amongst the princes of the world; so that whilst we have supported the honor of this high dignity, which belongs to us by right of sovereignty, it is more and more evident to all that the hand of the Lord hath done all this; and since His mercies are over all His works, let the worshippers of the orthodox faith henceforth know and relate it far and wide throughout the world, that He, who is blessed for ever, has visited and redeemed His people, and has raised up the horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David.

And before we leave the city of Jerusalem, we have determined magnificently to rebuild it, and its towers and walls, and we intend so to arrange matters that, during our absence, there shall be no less care and diligence used in the business, than if we were present in person. In order that this our present letter may be full of exultation throughout, and so a happy end correspond with its happy beginning, and rejoice your royal mind, we wish it to be known to you our ally, that the said sultan is bound to restore to us all those captives whom he did not in accordance with the treaty made between him and the Christians deliver up at the time when he lost Damietta some time since, and also the others who have been since taken.

Given at the holy city of Jerusalem, on the seventeenth day of the month of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand two hundred and twenty-nine.

&lt;poem&gt;
Going to Heaven!
I don't know when —
Pray do not ask me how!
Indeed I'm too astonished
To think of answering you!
Going to Heaven!
How dim it sounds!
And yet it will be done
As sure as flocks go home at night
Unto the Shepherd's arm!

Perhaps you're going too!
Who knows?
If you should get there first
Save just a little space for me
Close to the two I lost —
The smallest &quot;Robe&quot; will fit me
And just a bit of &quot;Crown&quot; —
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are going home —

I'm glad I don't believe it
For it would stop my breath —
And I'd like to look a little more
At such a curious Earth!
I'm glad they did believe it
Whom I have never found
Since the might Autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The Zola trial, which may properly be called
the latest, but not the last, phase of the {{small-caps|Dreyfus}}
case, has excited all over Europe a sort of tremulous
uncertainty as to how the strange condition of
things existing in France may affect the relations
of that country with the world outside.  It is
generally regarded as proving that in France the government,
and even the courts of justice, are at the
mercy of a most dangerous combination of
revolutionary influences capable of causing explosions of
an incalculably mischievous character.  This impression
is well borne out by the history of the
case in question.  Some years ago the general staff
of the French army were agitated by the belief
that, by persons connected with its military, secrets
of importance were betrayed to foreign governments.
A memorandum enumerating certain
pieces of such information, the famous
''bordereau'', was discovered, said to have been in the
possession of the German embassy in Paris.  Suspicion
was directed to Captain {{small-caps|Dreyfus}}, an officer
connected with the staff.  He was tried by
court martial in secret.  Some experts testified
that the ''bordereau'' was in his handwriting; others
testified that it was not.  Other so-called evidence
was brought forward, with which, however, the
accused man was not made acquainted.  He was
sentenced to be cashiered and to be transported to
Devil's Island.  The sentence was executed in the
most cruel fashion.  There the authorities hoped
that the matter would rest.  But a few months ago
a man of high standing, one of the Vice-Presidents
of the Senate, M. {{small-caps|Scheurer-Kestner}}, believing
that he had evidence of the innocence of {{small-caps|Dreyfus}},
expressed that belief publicly, and sought to induce
the government to reopen the case.  He met
with bitter resistance on the part of the chiefs of
the army.  But he stood not alone.  Other men of
prominence joined in his efforts, and there being
signs pointing strongly to Major Count {{small-caps|Esterhazy}}
&amp;mdash; a man of questionable repute, who had in
his private correspondence spoken of the French
army in a most scandalous manner &amp;mdash; as the real
culprit, the military authorities found themselves
under the necessity of subjecting him too to a trial
by court martial.  This trial was conducted in such
a manner as to appear to every unprejudiced
observer as a preconcerted farce, and Count {{small-caps|Esterhazy}}
was triumphantly acquitted, and cheered by
excited multitudes as a vindicator of the honor of
the French army.

Then the famous novelist {{small-caps|Emile Zola}} stepped
forward and publicly accused the heads of the army
of having by secret and arbitrary proceedings condemned
to an infamous punishment a man whose
guilt had not been proven, and of having, in order
to cover up this crime, in an equally arbitrary way
forced the acquittal of a guilty person.  What
{{small-caps|Zola}} intended by this public charge was, avowedly,
to oblige the government to prosecute him for
libel, and thus to give him an opportunity for proving
the innocence of {{small-caps|Dreyfus}} and the guilt of
{{small-caps|Esterhazy}}.  But {{small-caps|Zola}}
had reckoned without his
host.  He was, indeed, prosecuted for libel, but only
on the charges he had made with regard to the
{{small-caps|Esterhazy}} court martial &amp;mdash; a proceeding intended
to exclude all testimony concerning the {{small-caps|Dreyfus}}
case, and to confine that concerning {{small-caps|Esterhazy}}
within narrow limits.  As to the manner in which
the {{small-caps|Zola}} trial was conducted, it is not too
much to say that if a detailed and strictly truthful
report of it &amp;mdash; with all the partly timorous,
partly defiant refusals of witnesses to testify; with
the insolent and dictatorial harangues addressed to
the court and to the jury by generals of the army,
who were really the accused parties; with the arbitrary
rulings of the presiding judge in excluding
almost all the testimony which threatened to tell in
{{small-caps|Zola's}} favor; with the part which the howls of an
excited mob played in the proceedings; and with the
court's condemnation of {{small-caps|Zola}}, imposing upon him
the extreme measure of punishment &amp;mdash; had appeared
in a work of fiction, the verdict of the unbiased
reader would be that while a novelist may ask us
to accept many improbable things, he should not
ask us to believe that such an undisguised, ruthless
perversion of justice was possible in a high tribunal
of a civilized nation calling itself a republic at the
close of the nineteenth century.

Nothing could be more natural than that each
day's proceedings should have increased the number
of those who believe {{small-caps|Dreyfus}} innocent and
{{small-caps|Esterhazy}} guilty.  But worse was the conviction,
forced by the methods employed in the {{small-caps|Zola}} trial
upon every impartial mind, that the heads of the
army, having something of a gravely compromising
nature to conceal, would shrink from no means
ever so desperate to accomplish their purpose.
When the trial of {{small-caps|Zola}} proceeded upon the
assumption that the accused party was guilty and
had to prove his innocence, instead of assuming,
according to our principles of justice, that he must
be regarded as innocent unless his guilt were
proved, it acted only according to the established
French rule, strangely antiquated as that rule may
seem.  But when General {{small-caps|de Pellieux}}, a witness,
successfully clamored for the exclusion of testimony
required for the establishment of {{small-caps|Zola's}}
innocence, on the ground that its admission would be
derogatory to the dignity of the army, and when
General {{small-caps|Boisdeffre}}, also a witness, addressing the
jury, exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;You, gentlemen of the jury,
you are the nation here, for you represent it; and
if the nation has not confidence in the chiefs of
the army, let it say so, and we are ready to leave
to others the burden of our responsibility!&amp;rdquo; they
demanded nothing more nor less than that the
cause of justice to the citizen should be subordinate
to the interests of the army; and that demand, as
it was obeyed by the court and the jury, may
properly be called a blow struck at the most fundamental
principles of free government.

But the heads of the army went even farther
than this.  Taking advantage of the circumstance
that {{small-caps|Dreyfus}} is a Jew &amp;mdash; a circumstance which, in
the first instance, may have induced them to select
him as a scapegoat &amp;mdash; they called to their aid the
anti-semitic feeling, that meanest and most hideous
remnant of mediæval barbarism, which never
appears on the surface without an exhibition of the
basest impulses of human nature, casting a dark
shadow of disgrace on our boasted Christian
civilization.  And forthwith the shrill cry of
&amp;ldquo;Down with Jews!&amp;rdquo; mingled with cheers for the
army on the streets of Paris, while in the provinces
that cry actually excited the populace to pillage
and murder.  No less significant was the alliance
on this occasion between the army, seeking to
maintain its power and prestige, and the most
unruly and dangerous elements of the population,
represented by so inveterate an enemy of all
orderly government as {{small-caps|Henri Rochefort}} &amp;mdash; the
professional defenders of law and authority and
the professional revolutionary disturbers, so to
speak, locking arms and uniting in one cry against
those who sought only truth and justice!  In all her
internal commotions France has hardly ever beheld
a spectacle more grotesque and alarming than
this.

Thus, through moral terrorism and the excitement
of the bad passions of the multitude, the
chiefs of the army overawed judge and jury and
carried their point.  But they have not put the
trouble to rest.  It is true the Prime Minister, who,
there is good reason for believing, had watched
the proceeding with extreme discomfort, obtained
in Parliament, after an appeal for peace and quiet,
a vote substantially ratifying what had happened.
But the {{small-caps|Dreyfus}} case will rise up again, like
''Banquo's'' ghost, to torment the government and the
nation in a variety of forms &amp;mdash; not only in the appeal
to the court of last resort entered by {{small-caps|Zola}}, but
after that in the protests of conscience which are
sure to come from the thoughtful and self-respecting
citizens of the republic, and then, perhaps, in
more daring demonstrations of the praetorian spirit
in the army.  What at last may be the upshot of
the bewildering confusion and demoralization of
public sentiment in France nobody can foretell.
The army has fatally hurt its moral prestige by the
methods adopted for maintaining it.  The generals
will inevitably discover this.  It is by no means
improbable that they may think of restoring that
prestige by the desperate expedient of some warlike
enterprise on a great scale.  Such a scheme may
indeed be foiled, not only by the peaceable disposition
of the French people generally, but by the
Russian friend, who has his own policy, and who
will no doubt make them understand that the Russian
alliance will surely be forfeited by any foolish
venture on their part.  But the situation is full
of dark possibilities, and the French people, when
they come to their senses, will have learned once
more what it means to have a large standing army
in a republic.</text>

Mr. Justice Brewer (with whom Mr. Justice Shiras concurs) dissenting:

I am unable to concur in the opinion and judgment just announced, and will state briefly the ground for my dissent.

From the beginning of land grants the Land Department has exercised the power of withdrawing from pre-emption and homestead entry any body of lands which in its judgment might be necessary for the satisfaction of the grant. And the existence of this power has been affirmed by this court in many cases, and without a single exception up to the present decision. The grant for the improvement of the Des Moines river terminated, as finally decided, at the Raccoon fork of that river, about half way between the northern and southern boundary of the state of Iowa; yet a withdrawal of lands along that river above that fork, and up to the northern boundary of the state, was sustained.  ''Wolcott'' v. ''Des Moines Nav. &amp; R. Co.'' 5 Wall. 681, 18 L. ed. 689; ''Wolsey'' v. ''Chapman'', [[101 U.S. 755]], 25 L. ed. 915. It was held that as the extent of the grant was doubtful it was within the power of the Land Department, and also proper for it, to withdraw from settlement and sale all lands that might under any construction of the grant be needed to satisfy it. See, among other cases sustaining this power of withdrawal: ''Homestead Co.'' v. ''Valley R. Co.'' 17 Wall. 153, ''sub nom. Iowa Homestead Co.'' v. ''Des Moines Nav. &amp; R. Co.'' 21 L. ed. 622; ''Williams'' v. ''Baker'', 17 Wall. 144, 21 L. ed. 561; ''Dubuque &amp; S.C.. R. Co.'' v. ''Des Moines Valley R. Co.'' [[109 U.S. 329]], 332, 333, 27 L. ed. 952, 953, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 188; ''Bullard'' v. ''Des Moines &amp; Ft. D. R. Co.'' [[122 U.S. 167]], 170, 171, 176, 30 L. ed. 1123, 1124, 1126, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1149; ''United States'' v. ''Des Moines Nav. &amp; R. Co.'' [[142 U.S. 510]], 528, 35 L. ed. 1099, 1102, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 308; ''Hamblin'' v. ''Western Land Co.'' [[147 U.S. 531]], 536, 37 L. ed. 267, 271, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 353; ''Riley'' v. ''Welles'', [[154 U.S. 578]], and 19 L. ed. 648, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1166; ''Wood'' v. ''Beach'', [[156 U.S. 548]], 39 L. ed. 528, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410; ''Wisconsin C. R. Co.'' v. ''Forsythe'', [[159 U.S. 46]], 54, 57, 40 L. ed. 71, 74, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1020; ''Spencer'' v. ''McDougal'', [[159 U.S. 62]], 64, 40 L. ed. 76, 77, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1026; ''Northern P. R. Co.'' v. ''Musser-Sauntry Land, Logging &amp; Mfg. Co.'' [[168 U.S. 604]], 607, 42 L. ed. 596, 597, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 205.

It is to be assumed that when Congress makes a grant of a certain number of sections per mile it intends that its grantee shall obtain that number of sections. And when it provides that, if there be not within the place limits the requisite number of sections free from homestead or pre-emption entry, the grantee may go into an idemnity limit and select enough to complete the full amount of the grant, its purpose is that within this territory added for selection the grantee shall receive a full equivalent for the deficiencies in the place limits. Action by the administrative department which tends to accomplish this purpose is, to say the least, not inconsistent with justice. And in order that it be not defeated, it is certainly not unreasonable to temporarily withdraw from private entry a sufficient body of land within such indemnity limits.

That in the actual administration of the Northern Pacific land grant such withdrawals of land within the indemnity limits were proper is clear from the certificate of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, of date May 2, 1896, and in evidence in this case to the effect that there is a known deficiency of 3,559,222 acres of the grant which cannot be satisfied from the limits recognized in the department. As this certificate was the only evidence in the case and was incorporated by the trial court into its findings of fact, it would seem that our inquiry in this direction should be limited thereby. But in the opinion of the majority there is a reference to a report of the Land Department, made a year after the decision in this case, and to two opinions of the Secretary of the Interior, announced about the time of the decision. In these some question is made of the accuracy of this certificate. It will be noticed that in neither report nor opinions is the fact of a deficiency denied, but only a suggestion as to the amount thereof. It is, of course, not a pleasant fact that by reason of the change in the ruling and practice of the Land Department the Northern Pacific Railroad Company fails to receiver the full measure of its grant, and I do not wonder at any effort to discredit the fact or minimize the amount of such loss, but I submit that in the disposition of this case we ought to be guided by the evidence before us and not be misled by recent speculations of the department concerning what may yet be developed.

Much is said about the vastness of this land grant, but it must be remembered that it was a grant of lands within what was then a wilderness. Though it was made in 1864, nothing was done towards the building of the road until more than six years afterwards. Capital finds little temptation in a promise, no matter how great, of lands in an unknown wilderness.

The Land Department, believing that the power so constantly exercised by it and so frequently sustained by this court still continued, made orders of withdrawal as from time to time the maps of the line of definite location were filed and approved. Indeed, the question of power in respect to this very Northern Pacific grant was distinctly presented to Secretary Teller on May 17, 1883, and affirmed by him in a letter of instructions to the Commissioner of the General Land Office. 2 Land Dec. 511. See also Id. 506. These withdrawals prior to the ruling hereafter noticed were over forty in number, and included substantially all the odd-numbered sections within the 10-mile indemnity limit from one end of the road to the other. They continued with unbroken regularity until the ruling referred to.

The first section of constructed road of 25 miles in length was accepted by the President on January 6, 1873, as having been finished on October 18, 1872. The last section of constructed road was accepted on July 10, 1888, as having been finished on June 11, 1888. During these years of construction, and of course as inducement to the company to continue the work undertaken, these various withdrawals were made. Not until 1887 was there any question of their validity. The first intimation appears in an opinion announced by Mr. Justice Lamar (then Secretary of the Interior) on August 13, 1887 (6 Land Dec. 84, 87), in which he said:

'Were I called upon to treat as an original proposition the question as to the legal authority of the Secretary to withdraw from the operation of the settlement laws lands within the indemnity limits of said grant, I should, at least, have such doubts of the existence of any such authority as to have restrained me of its exercise. It would seem that the very words of the act, 'the odd-numbered sections of land hereby granted shall not be liable to sale, or entry, or pre-emption before or after they are surveyed, except by said company, as provided in this act,' of themselves indicate most clearly the legislative will that there should not be withdrawn for the benefit of said company from sale or entry any other lands, except the odd-numbered sections within the granted limits, as expressly designated in the act. But when the provision following this, in the very same sentence, is considered,-'but the provisions of the act of September, 1841, granting pre-emption rights, and the acts amendatory thereof,' and of the act entitled 'An Act to Secure Homesteads to Actual Settlers upon the Public Domain,' approved May 20, 1862, 'shall be, and the same are hereby, extended to all other lands on the line of said road when surveyed, excepting those hereby granted to said company,'-it is difficult to resist the conclusion that Congress intended that 'all other lands, excepting those hereby granted to said company,' shall be open to settlement under the pre-emption and homestead laws, and to prohibit the exercise of any discretion in the Executive in the matter of determining what lands shall or shall not be withdrawn.'

Following this opinion Secretary Lamar revoked the orders of withdrawal theretofore made in behalf of some twenty-four corporations, the Northern Pacific Railroad Company among the number. Such revocation was undoubtedly legal, for the power which could order a withdrawal could revoke such order whenever in its judgment the appropriate time therefor had arrived. But such revocation did not disturb the rights which had become vested during the continuance of the orders of withdrawal. Thus consistency in the rulings and practice of the Department was preserved.

Subsequently the question was presented to Secretary Vilas, who on August 2, 1888, in the case of the ''Northern P. R. Co.'' v. ''Miller'', 7 Land Dec. 100, ruled that all these withdrawals were void, thus upsetting that which had been done in the administration of this grant from the time of its inception.

It is unfortunate that during the years of construction, when it seemed important to hold out every inducement to the company to continue its work, the ruling and practice of the Land Department should have been unvarying in the line of securing to it the full amount of its grant, and that as soon as the road was completed and no further inducement to action by the company was needed, the ruling of the Land Department should be changed, and that theretofore done with a view of securing to it the full amount of its grant be declared void. A change in the ruling of the Department at that time was inauspicious.

Reference is made in the opinion to the duty of following in doubtful cases the construction placed by the Land Department. I fully agree with this, and I think it is a duty as incumbent upon the Department as on the courts, and that when a construction has been once established in respect to a particular matter it should be followed by the Department, unless plainly wrong; and that this court, when the question is presented, should hold to the original construction, especially if it be one which obtained during a score of years, and during all the time that the company was engaged in doing the work for which the grant was made, and should refuse to uphold a change made after that work was completed, and which has the effect of unsettling and destroying the rights of many created in reliance upon that construction.

Was the power of withdrawal rightfully exercised by the Land Department? It is not pretended that the Northern Pacific act contains any express denial or taking away of such power. The conclusion that it was taken away rests upon a mere implication, but it is familiar law that repeals by implication are not favored. If the old law and the new are consistent, and can with any reasonable interpretation of the latter be both enforced, they will be; and I respectfully submit that the same rule obtains as to powers belonging to and exercised by a department.

Was there any implied denial of this power to the Land Department? § 6 of the granting act is relied upon by Secretary Vilas and by this court. I quote the section (13 Stat. at L. 369, chap. 217):

'That the President of the United States shall cause the lands to be surveyed for forty miles in width on both sides of the entire line of said road, after the general route shall be fixed, and as fast as may be required by the construction of said railroad; and the odd sections of land hereby granted shall not be liable to sale, or entry, or pre-emption before or after they are surveyed, except by said company, as provided in this act; but the provisions of the act of September, eighteen hundred and forty-one, granting pre-emption rights, and the acts amendatory thereof, and of the act entitled 'An Act to Secure Homesteads to Actual Settlers on the Public Domain,' approved May twenty, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, shall be, and the same are hereby, extended to all other lands on the line of said road, when surveyed, excepting those hereby granted to said company. And the reserved alternate sections shall not be sold by the government at a price less than two dollars and fifty cents per acre, when offered for sale.'

Now, confessedly, every part of this section, except the clause commencing 'but the provisions,' and ending 'to said company,' applies solely to lands within the place limits, and has no reference or application to lands within the indemnity limits. By its connection, therefore, the natural application of this clause would be to lands within like limits. This natural application is enforced by the words 'when surveyed,' near the close of the clause, for there is an express provision (as appears in the first of the section) for a survey of the place limits, and there is no reference in the entire body of the act to any other survey. Further, the clause was seemingly necessary to secure beyond question to pre-emptors and those seeking homesteads a full and continuous right to the even-numbered sections within the place limits. The pre-emption law of September 4, 1841 (5 Stat. at L. 456, chap. 16), defining the classes of lands to which preemption rights should not extend, included therein the following:

'No sections of land reserved to the United States alternate to other sections granted to any of the states for the construction of any canal, railroad, or other, public improvement.'

The act of March 3, 1853 (10 Stat. at L. 244, chap. 143), which extended the pre-emption right to the alternate reserved sections, contained this provision:

'''Provided'', That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, who has not settled and improved, or shall not settle and improve, such lands prior to the final allotment of the alternate sections to such railroads by the General Land Office.'

The exact scope of this limitation as applied to grants directly to railroad companies may not be entirely clear. Perhaps the limitation began with the approval of the map of definite location which, as frequently held, determines the time at which the right of the company to the odd-numbered sections is established, or perhaps, at least in cases where the grant was to a state, instead of directly to a company, at the date of the official certification to the state of the list of allotted lands. Such at least seems to have been the opinion of the Land Office, as shown by the rules announced. 1 Lester, 509. Be that as it may, some limitation was prescribed, and this clause was unquestionably introduced in order to remove all doubt as to the full and continuous right of pre-emption in respect to the alternate reserved sections. The same provision was found in several land grants, as, for instance, that to the California &amp; Oregon Railroad Company, July 25, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 239, chap. 242); that to the Atlantic &amp; Pacific Railroad Company, July 27, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 292, chap. 278); that to the Stockton &amp; Copperopolis Railroad Company, March 2, 1867 (14 Stat. at L. 548, chap. 189); that to the Oregon Central Railroad Company, May 4, 1870 (16 Stat. at L. 94, chap. 69); that to the Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad Company, March 3, 1871 (16 Stat. at L. 573, chap. 122). That it did not apply to lands outside the place and within the indemnity limits is made clear by the fact that the provision was introduced into an act in which there were no indemnity limits, to wit, the act of July 13, 1866, granting lands to the Placerville and Sacramento Valley Railroad Company (14 Stat. at L. 94, chap. 182).

Reference is made in the opinion of Secretary Vilas, approved by this court, to ''United States'' v. ''Burlington &amp; M. River R. Co.'' [[98 U.S. 334]], 25 L. ed. 198, as indicative that the words 'on the line of said road' necessarily extend to lands within the indemnity limits. But that case justifies no such inference. There were no place or indemnity limits in terms prescribed. There was simply a grant of ten alternate sections per mile on each side of the road 'on the line thereof.' When the right of the company attached it was found that the full complement of the grant could not be satisfied by the ten successive alternate sections; and on application of the company patents were issued to it for certain lands beyond the limits of those sections, and the court held on a bill to set aside these patents that the action of the Land Department was justified in that the full amount of the grant was intended and that there were no prescribed limits within which the grant must be satisfied. It was said (p. 340, L. ed. p. 200), that the words 'do not require the lands to be contiguous to the road; and if not contiguous, it is not easy to say at what distance the land to be selected would cease to be along its line;' and again, 'and the land was taken along such line in the sense of the statute, when taken along the general direction or course of the road within lines perpendicular to it at each end.'

It is also suggested that to disturb this decision of the Land Department in 1888 might work confusion in the administration of the grant and entail hardship on many who have acted in reliance upon that ruling. I concede the hardship. Every change in the ruling of the Land Department in the administration of a grant will almost inevitably work hardship upon some; but it is well to note the comparative hardships; and no better illustration can be presented than the case at bar; and this, irrespective of the loss by the company of a large portion of its promised lands. The plaintiff in error, immediately upon his application for an entry of the tract in controversy, was notified that it was withdrawn. He could then easily have changed his settlement to an even numbered section, and perfected his title thereto. He persevered, however, in his application, and was finally allowed pre-emption, paid his money and received his patent. If that action were now adjudged void he would have a claim for the money paid and a claim against a solvent debtor. Rev. Stat. § 2362. On the other hand, the defendant in error, who purchased from the railroad company in reliance upon the then ruling of the Department, paid to the company the sum of $1,200, and has placed upon the lands improvements to the value of $600. All this he loses; and while he may have a claim against the company for the amount of money he paid it, yet if it be true (as I am informed, although not appearing in the record) that mortgages upon the railroad company property have been foreclosed and all its property disposed of, his judgment will be simply against an insolvent corporation. In other words, instead of a claim for reimbursement against a solvent debtor, he will have what is tantamount to a judgment against a vacuum; and this will be the experience of all who, during those many years, purchased from the company in reliance upon the then ruling of the Department.

For the reasons thus outlined I dissent from the opinion and judgment, and I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Shiras concurs herein.

==Chapter XXII==

Northward, along the leeward coast of Malaita, the &lt;i&gt;Ariel&lt;/i&gt; worked her
leisurely way, threading the colour-riotous lagoon that lay between the
shore-reefs and outer-reefs, daring passages so narrow and coral-patched
that Captain Winters averred each day added a thousand grey hairs to his
head, and dropping anchor off every walled inlet of the outer reef and
every mangrove swamp of the mainland that looked promising of cannibal
life.  For Harley and Villa Kennan were in no hurry.  So long as the way
was interesting, they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to
anywhere.

During this time Jerry learned a new name for himself--or, rather, an
entire series of names for himself.  This was because of an aversion on
Harley Kennan's part against renaming a named thing.

&quot;A name he must have had,&quot; he argued to Villa.  &quot;Haggin must have named
him before he sailed on the &lt;i&gt;Arangi&lt;/i&gt;.  Therefore, nameless he must be
until we get back to Tulagi and find out his real name.&quot;

&quot;What's in a name?&quot; Villa had begun to tease.

&quot;Everything,&quot; her husband retorted.  &quot;Think of yourself, shipwrecked,
called by your rescuers 'Mrs. Riggs,' or 'Mademoiselle de Maupin,' or
just plain 'Topsy.'  And think of me being called 'Benedict Arnold,' or '
Judas,' or . . . or . . . 'Haman.'  No, keep him nameless, until we find
out his original name.&quot;

&quot;Must call him something,&quot; she objected.  &quot;Can't think of him without
thinking something.&quot;

&quot;Then call him many names, but never the same name twice.  Call him 'Dog'
to-day, and 'Mister Dog' to-morrow, and the next day something else.&quot;

So it was, more by tone and emphasis and context of situation than by
anything else, that Jerry came hazily to identify himself with names such
as: Dog, Mister Dog, Adventurer, Strong Useful One, Sing Song Silly,
Noname, and Quivering Love-Heart.  These were a few of the many names
lavished on him by Villa.  Harley, in turn, addressed him as: Man-Dog,
Incorruptible One, Brass Tacks, Then Some, Sin of Gold, South Sea Satrap,
Nimrod, Young Nick, and Lion-Slayer.  In brief, the man and woman
competed with each other to name him most without naming him ever the
same.  And Jerry, less by sound and syllable than by what of their hearts
vibrated in their throats, soon learned to know himself by any name they
chose to address to him.  He no longer thought of himself as Jerry, but,
instead, as any sound that sounded nice or was love-sounded.

His great disappointment (if &quot;disappointment&quot; may be considered to
describe an unconsciousness of failure to realize the expected) was in
the matter of language.  No one on board, not even Harley and Villa,
talked Nalasu's talk.  All Jerry's large vocabulary, all his proficiency
in the use of it, which would have set him apart as a marvel beyond all
other dogs in the mastery of speech, was wasted on those of the &lt;i&gt;Ariel&lt;/i&gt;.
They did not speak, much less guess, the existence of the whiff-whuff
shorthand language which Nalasu had taught him, and which, Nalasu dead,
Jerry alone knew of all living creatures in the world.

In vain Jerry tried it on the lady-god.  Sitting squatted on his
haunches, his head bowed forward and held between her hands, he would
talk and talk and elicit never a responsive word from her.  With tiny
whines and thin whimperings, with whiffs and whuffs and growly sorts of
noises down in his throat, he would try to tell her somewhat of his tale.
She was all meltingness of sympathy; she would hold her ear so near to
the articulate mouth of him as almost to drown him in the flowing
fragrance of her hair; and yet her brain told her nothing of what he
uttered, although her heart surely sensed his intent.

&quot;Bless me, Husband-Man!&quot; she would cry out.  &quot;The Dog is talking.  I know
he is talking.  He is telling me all about himself.  The story of his
life is mine, could I but understand.  It's right here pouring into my
miserable inadequate ears, only I can't catch it.&quot;

Harley was sceptical, but her woman's intuition guessed aright.

&quot;I know it!&quot; she would assure her husband.  &quot;I tell you he could tell the
tale of all his adventures if only we had understanding.  No other dog
has ever talked this way to me.  There's a tale there.  I feel its
touches.  Sometimes almost do I know he is telling of joy, of love, of
high elation, and combat.  Again, it is indignation, hurt of outrage,
despair and sadness.&quot;

&quot;Naturally,&quot; Harley agreed quietly.  &quot;A white man's dog, adrift among the
anthropophagi of Malaita, would experience all such sensations and, just
as naturally, a white man's woman, a Wife-Woman, a dear, delightful Villa
Kennan woman, can of herself imagine such a dog's experiences and deem
his silly noises a recital of them, failing to recognize them as
projections of her own delicious, sensitive, sympathetic self.  The song
of the sea from the lips of the shell--Pshaw!  The song oneself makes of
the sea and puts into the shell.&quot;

&quot;Just the same--&quot;

&quot;Always the same,&quot; he gallantly cut her off.  &quot;Always right, especially
when most wrong.  Not in navigation, of course, nor in affairs such as
the multiplication table, where the brass tacks of reality stud the way
of one's ship among the rocks and shoals of the sea; but right, truth
beyond truth to truth higher than truth, namely, intuitional truth.&quot;

&quot;Now you are laughing at me with your superior man-wisdom,&quot; she retorted.
&quot;But I know--&quot; she paused for the strength of words she needed, and words
forsook her, so that her quick sweeping gesture of hand-touch to heart
named authority that overrode all speech.

&quot;We agree--I salute,&quot; he laughed gaily.  &quot;It was just precisely what I
was saying.  Our hearts can talk our heads down almost any time, and,
best all, our hearts are always right despite the statistic that they are
mostly wrong.&quot;

Harley Kennan did not believe, and never did believe, his wife's report
of the tales Jerry told.  And through all his days to the last one of
them, he considered the whole matter a pleasant fancy, all poesy of
sentiment, on Villa's part.

But Jerry, four-legged, smooth-coated, Irish terrier that he was, had the
gift of tongues.  If he could not teach languages, at least he could
learn languages.  Without effort, and quickly, practically with no
teaching, he began picking up the language of the &lt;i&gt;Ariel&lt;/i&gt;.  Unfortunately,
it was not a whiff-whuff, dog-possible language such as Nalasu had
invented.  While Jerry came to understand much that was spoken on the
&lt;i&gt;Ariel&lt;/i&gt;, he could speak none of it.  Three names, at least, he had for
the lady-god: &quot;Villa,&quot; &quot;Wife-Woman,&quot; &quot;Missis Kennan,&quot; for so he heard her
variously called.  But he could not so call her.  This was god-language
entire, which only gods could talk.  It was unlike the language of
Nalasu's devising, which had been a compromise between god-talk and dog-
talk, so that a god and a dog could talk in the common medium.

In the same way he learned many names for the one-man god: &quot;Mister
Kennan,&quot; &quot;Harley,&quot; &quot;Captain Kennan,&quot; and &quot;Skipper.&quot;  Only in the intimacy
of the three of them alone did Jerry hear him called: &quot;Husband-Man,&quot; &quot;My
Man,&quot; &quot;Patient One,&quot; &quot;Dear Man,&quot; &quot;Lover,&quot; and &quot;This Woman's Delight.&quot;  But
in no way could Jerry utter these names in address of the one-man nor the
many names in address of the one-woman.  Yet on a quiet night with no
wind among the trees, often and often had he whispered to Nalasu, by
whiff-whuff of name, from a hundred feet away.

One day, bending over him, her hair (drying from a salt-water swim)
flying about him, the one-woman, her two hands holding his head and jowls
so that his ribbon of kissing tongue just missed her nose in the empty
air, sang to him: &quot;'Don't know what to call him, but he's mighty lak' a
rose!'&quot;

On another day she repeated this, at the same time singing most of the
song to him softly in his ear.  In the midst of it Jerry surprised her.
Equally true might be the statement that he surprised himself.  Never,
had he consciously done such a thing before.  And he did it without
volition.  He never intended to do it.  For that matter, the very thing
he did was what mastered him into doing it.  No more than could he
refrain from shaking the water from his back after a swim, or from
kicking in his sleep when his feet were tickled, could he have avoided
doing this imperative thing.

As her voice, in the song, made soft vibrations in his ears, it seemed to
him that she grew dim and vague before him, and that somehow, under the
soft searching prod of her song, he was otherwhere.  So much was he
otherwhere that he did the surprising thing.  He sat down abruptly,
almost cataleptically, drew his head away from the clutch of her hands
and out of the entanglement of her hair, and, his nose thrust upward at
an angle of forty-five degrees, he began to quiver and to breathe audibly
in rhythm to the rhythm of her singing.  With a quick jerk,
cataleptically, his nose pointed to the zenith, his mouth opened, and a
flood of sound poured forth, running swiftly upward in crescendo and
slowly falling as it died away.

This howl was the beginning, and it led to the calling him &quot;Sing Song
Silly.&quot;  For Villa Kennan was quick to seize upon the howling her singing
induced and to develop it.  Never did he hang back when she sat down,
extended her welcoming hands to him, and invited: &quot;Come on, Sing Song
Silly.&quot;  He would come to her, sit down with the loved fragrance of her
hair in his nostrils, lay the side of his head against hers, point his
nose past her ear, and almost immediately follow her when she began her
low singing.  Minor strains were especially provocative in getting him
started, and, once started, he would sing with her as long as she wished.

Singing it truly was.  Apt in all ways of speech, he quickly learned to
soften and subdue his howl till it was mellow and golden.  Even could he
manage it to die away almost to a whisper, and to rise and fall,
accelerate and retard, in obedience to her own voice and in accord with
it.

Jerry enjoyed the singing much in the same way the opium eater enjoys his
dreams.  For dream he did, vaguely and indistinctly, eyes wide open and
awake, the lady-god's hair in a faint-scented cloud about him, her voice
mourning with his, his consciousness drowning in the dreams of
otherwhereness that came to him of the singing and that was the singing.
Memories of pain were his, but of pain so long forgotten that it was no
longer pain.  Rather did it permeate him with a delicious sadness, and
lift him away and out of the &lt;i&gt;Ariel&lt;/i&gt; (lying at anchor in some coral
lagoon) to that unreal place of Otherwhere.

For visions were his at such times.  In the cold bleakness of night, it
would seem he sat on a bare hill and raised his howl to the stars, while
out of the dark, from far away, would drift to him an answering howl.  And
other howls, near and far, would drift along until the night was vocal
with his kind.  His kind it was.  Without knowing it he &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; it, this
camaraderie of the land of Otherwhere.

Nalasu, in teaching him the whiff-whuff language, deliberately had gone
into the intelligence of him; but Villa, unwitting of what she was doing,
went into the heart of him, and into the heart of his heredity, touching
the profoundest chords of ancient memories and making them respond.

As instance: dim shapes and shadowy forms would sometimes appear to him
out of the night, and as they flitted spectrally past he would hear, as
in a dream, the hunting cries of the pack; and, as his pulse quickened,
his own hunting instinct would rouse until his controlled soft-howling in
the song broke into eager whinings.  His head would lower out of the
entanglement of the woman's hair; his feet would begin making restless,
spasmodic movements as if running; and Presto, in a flash, he would be
out and away, across the face of time, out of reality and into the dream,
himself running in the midst of those shadowy forms in the hunting
fellowship of the pack.

And as men have ever desired the dust of the poppy and the juice of the
hemp, so Jerry desired the joys that were his when Villa Kennan opened
her arms to him, embraced him with her hair, and sang him across time and
space into the dream of his ancient kind.

Not always, however, were such experiences his when they sang together.
Usually, unaccompanied by visions, he knew no more than vaguenesses of
sensations, sadly sweet, ghosts of memories that they were.  At other
times, incited by such sadness, images of Skipper and Mister Haggin would
throng his mind; images, too, of Terrence, and Biddy, and Michael, and
the rest of the long-vanished life at Meringe Plantation.

&quot;My dear,&quot; Harley said to Villa at the conclusion of one such singing,
&quot;it's fortunate for him that you are not an animal trainer, or, rather, I
suppose, it would be better called 'trained animal show-woman'; for you'd
be topping the bill in all the music-halls and vaudeville houses of the
world.&quot;

&quot;If I did,&quot; she replied, &quot;I know he'd just love to do it with me--&quot;

&quot;Which would make it a very unusual turn,&quot; Harley caught her up.

&quot;You mean . . .?&quot;

&quot;That in about one turn in a hundred does the animal love its work or is
the animal loved by its trainer.&quot;

&quot;I thought all the cruelty had been done away with long ago,&quot; she
contended.

&quot;So the audience thinks, and the audience is ninety-nine times wrong.&quot;

Villa heaved a great sigh of renunciation as she said, &quot;Then I suppose I
must abandon such promising and lucrative career right now in the very
moment you have discovered it for me.  Just the same the billboards would
look splendid with my name in the hugest letters--&quot;

&quot;Villa Kennan the Thrush-throated Songstress, and Sing Song Silly the
Irish-Terrier Tenor,&quot; her husband pictured the head-lines for her.

And with dancing eyes and lolling tongue Jerry joined in the laughter,
not because he knew what it was about, but because it tokened they were
happy and his love prompted him to be happy with them.

For Jerry had found, and in the uttermost, what his nature craved--the
love of a god.  Recognizing the duality of their lordship over the
&lt;i&gt;Ariel&lt;/i&gt;, he loved the pair of them; yet, somehow, perhaps because she had
penetrated deepest into his heart with her magic voice that transported
him to the land of Otherwhere, he loved the lady-god beyond all love he
had ever known, not even excluding his love for Skipper.</text>

===Ham===
Two days Biddulph solaced himself on those rare luxuries of Ruby’s ''ménage''; the third, we started.

Ruby and the surgeon rode with us a score of miles. It was hard to say good-bye. We were grateful, and they were sorry.

“What can we do for you, Ruby?”

“Raze Laramie, abolish the plains, level the Rockys, nullify the Sioux, and disband the American army.”

“What can we do for you, Doctor?”

“Find me a wife, box her up so that no one will stop her ''in transitu'', mark Simeon Pathie, M. D., U. S. A., and ship to Fort Vancouver, Oregon, where I shall be stationed next summer. Your English lady in half a day has spoiled my philosophy of a life.”

“Good-bye and good luck!”

It was late travelling through that houseless waste. Deep snow already blanched the Black Hills, and Laramie Peak, their chief. Mr. Bierstadt, in his fine picture in this year’s Academy, has shown them as they are in the mellow days of summer. Now, cold and stern, they warned us to hasten on.

We did hasten. We crowded through the buffalo; we crossed and recrossed the Platte, already curdling with winter; we dashed over the prairies of Kansas, blackened by fire and whitened by snow, but then unstained by any peaceful settler’s blood.

Jake Shamberlain, returning with his party, met us on the way.

“I passed the train with the young woman and her father,” said he. “We camped together one night, and bein’ as I was a friend of your ’n, she give me a talk. Pooty tall talkin’ ’t wuz, and I wuz teched in a new spot. I’ve felt mean as muck ever sence she opened to me on religion, and when I git home I’m goan to swing clear of the Church, ef I ken cut clear, and emigrate to Oregon. So, Barrownight, next time you come out, you’ll find me on a claim there, out to the Willamette or the Umpqua, just as much like a gentleman’s park in England as one grasshopper is to another, only they hain’t got no such mountains to England as I’ll show you thar.”

“Well, Jake, we’ll try to pay you our respects.”

We hastened on. Why pause for our adventures? They were but episodes along our new gallop of three. This time it was not restless, anxious gallop. We had no doubt but that in good time we should overtake our friends, in regions where men are not shot along the right arm when they protect insulted dames.

Brent was himself again. We rode hard. Biddulph was as fine a fellow as my grandmother England has mothered. Find an Englishman vital enough to be a Come-outer, and you have found a man worthy to be the peer of an American with Yankee education. Western scope, and California irrepressibility.

Winter chased us close. Often we woke at night, and found our bivouac sheeted with cold snow, — a cool sheet, but luckily outside our warm blankets. It was full December when the plains left us, fell back, and beached us upon the outer edge of civilization, at Independence, Missouri.

The muddy Missouri was running dregs. Steamboats were tired of skipping from sand-bar to sand-bar. Engineer had reported to Captain, that “Kangaroo No. 5 would bust, if he didn’t stop trying to make her lift herself over the damp country by her braces.” No more steam-boating on the yellow ditch until there was a rise; until the Platte sent down sand three and water one, or the Yellowstone mud three and water one, or the Missouri proper grit three and water one. We must travel by land to St. Louis and railroads.

We could go with our horses as fast as the stage-coaches. So we sold our pack beasts, and started to continue our gallop of three across Missouri.

Half-way across, we stopped one evening at the mean best tavern in a mean town, — a frowzy county town, with a dusty public square, a boxy church, and a spittley court-house.

Fit entertainment for beast the tavern offered. We saw our horses stabled, and had our supper.

“Shall we go into the Spittoon?” said Biddulph.

“Certainly,” said Brent. “The bar-room — I am sorry to hear you speak of it with foreign prejudice — is an institution, and merits study. Argee, upon the which the bar-room is based, is also an institution.”

“Well, I came to study American institutions. Let us go in and take a whiff of disgust.”

Fit entertainment for brute the bar-room offered. In that club-room we found the brute class drinking, swearing, spitting, squabbling over the price of hemp and the price of “niggers,” and talking what it called “politics.”

One tall, truculent Pike, the loudest of all that blatant crew, seemed to Brent and myself an old acquaintance. We had seen him or his double somewhere. But neither of us could fit him with a pedestal in our long gallery of memory. Saints one takes pains to remember, and their scenes; but satyrs one endeavors to lose.

“Have you had enough of the Spittoon?” I asked Biddulph. “Shall we go up? They’ve put us all three in the same room; but bivouacs in the same big room — Out-Doors — are what we are best used to.”

Two and a half beds, one broken-backed chair, a wash-stand decked with an ancient fringed towel and an abandoned tooth-brush, one torn slipper, and a stove-pipe hole, furnished our bedchamber.

We were about to cast lots for the half-bed, when we heard two men enter the next room. The partition was only paper pasted over lath, and cut up as if a Border Ruffian member of Congress had practised at it with a bowie-knife before a street-fight. Every word of our neighbors came to us. They were talking of a slave bargain. I eliminate their oaths, though such filtration does them injustice.

“Eight hundred dollars,” said the first speaker, and his voice startled us as if a dead man we knew had spoken. “Eight hundred, — that’s the top of my pile fur that boy. Ef he warn’t so old and hadn’t one eye poked out, I agree he’d be wuth a heap more.”

“Waal, a trade’s a trade. I’ll take yer stump. Count out yer dimes, and I’ll fill out a blank bill of sale. Murker, the boy’s yourn.”

“Murker!” — we both started at the name. This was the satyr we had observed in the bar-room. Had Fulano’s victim crept from under his cairn in Luggernel Alley, and chased us to take flesh here and harm us again. Such a superstitious thought crossed my mind.

The likeness — look, voice, and name — was presently accounted for.

“You’re lookin’ fur yer brother out from Sacramenter, ’bout now, I reckon,” said the trader.

“He wuz comin’ cross lots with a man named Larrap, a pardener of his’n. Like enough they’ve stayed over winter in Salt Lake. They oughter rake down a most a mountainious pile thar.”

“Mormons is flush and sarcy with their dimes sence the emigration. Now thar’s yer bill of sale, all right.”

“And thar’s yer money, all right.”

“That are’s wut I call a screechin’ good price fur an old one-eyed nigger. Fourteen hundred dollars, — an all-fired price.”

“Eight hundred, you mean.”

“No; fourteen. Yer see, you’re not up ter taime on the nigger question. I know ’em like a church-steeple. When I bought that are boy, now comin’ three year, I seed he wuz a sprightly nigger, one er yer ambitious sort, what would be mighty apt to git fractious, an’ be makin’ tracks, onless I got a holt on him. So sez I to him, ‘Ham, you’re a sprightly nigger, one of the raal ambitious sort, now aincher?’ He allowed he warnt nothin’ else. ‘Waal,’ sez I, ‘Ham, how’d you like to buy yerself, an’ be a free nigger, an’ hev a house of yer own, an’ a woman of yer own, all jess like white folks?’ ‘Lor,’ sez he, ‘Massa, I’d like it a heap.’ ‘Waal,’ sez I, ‘you jess scrabble round an’ raise me seven hundred dollars, an’ I’ll sell you to yerself, an’ cheap at that.’ So yer see he began to pay up, an’ I got a holt on him. He’s a handy nigger, an’ a likely nigger, an’ a pop’lar nigger. He ken play on ther fiddle like taime, — pooty nigh a minstril is that are nigger. He ken cut hair an’ fry a beef-steak with ayry man. He ken drive team, an’ do a little j’iner work, an’ shoe a mule when thar ain’t no reg’lar blacksmith round. He made these yer boots, an’ reg’lar stompers they is. He’s one er them chirrupy, smilin’ niggers, with white teeth an’ genteel manners, what critturs an’ foaks nat’rally takes to. Waal, he picked up the bits and quarters right smart. He’s ben at it, lammin’ ahead raal ambitious, for ’bout three year. Last Sunday, after church, he pinted up the last ten of the six hundred. So I allowed ’t waz come time to sell him. He wuz gettin’ his bead drawed, an’ his idees sot on freedom very onhealthy. I didn’t like to disapp’int him to ther last; so I allowed ’t wuz jest as well to let you hev him cheap to go down River. That’s how to work them fractious runaway niggers. That are’s my patent. You ken hev it for nothin’. Haw! haw!”

“Haw, haw, haw! You are one er ther boys. I’m dum sorry that are trick can’t be did twicet on the same nigger. I reckon he knows too much for that. Waal, s’pose we walk round to the calaboose, ’fore we go to bed, an’ see ef he’s chained up all right.”

They went out.

Biddulph spoke first.

“Shame!”

“Yes,” said Brent; “do you wonder that we have to run away to the Rockys and spend our indignation on grizzlys?”

“What are we going to do now?”

“Try to abolish slavery in Ham’s case. Come; we’ll go buy him a file.”

“We seem to have business with the Murker family,” said I.

“A hard lot they are. Representative brutes!”

“I am getting a knowledge of all classes on your continent,” said Biddulph. “Some I like better than others!”

“Don’t be too harsh on us malecontents for the sin of slavery. It is an ancestral taint. We shall burn it out before many decades.”

“You had better, or it will set your own house on fire.”

It was late as we walked along the streets, channels of fever and ague now frozen up for the winter. We saw a light through a shop door, and hammered stoutly for admission.

A clerk, long-haired and frowzy, opened ungraciously. In the back shop were three others, also long-haired and frowzy, dealing cards and drinking a dark compost from tumblers.

“Port wine,” whispered Brent. “Fine Old London Dock Port is the favorite beverage, when the editor, the lawyer, the apothecary, and the merchant meet to play euchre in Missouri.”

We bought our files from the surly clerk, and made for the calaboose. It was a stout log structure, with grated windows. At one of these, by the low moonlight, we saw a negro. It was cold and late. Nobody was near. We hailed the man.

“Ham.”

“That’s me, Massa.”

“You’re sold to Murker, to go south to-morrow morning. If you want to get free, catch!”

Brent tossed him up the files.

“Catch again!” said Biddulph, and up went a rattling purse, England’s subsidy.

Ham’s white teeth and genteel manners appeared at once. He grinned, and whispered thanks.

“Is that all we can do?” asked the Baronet, as we walked off.

“Yes,” said Brent, taking a nasal tone. “Ham’s a pop’lar nigger, a handy nigger, one er your raal ambitious sort. He ken cut hair, fry a beefsteak, and play on the fiddle like a minstril. He ken shoe a mule, drive a team, do a little j’iner work, and make stompers. Yes, Biddulph, trust him to gnaw himself free with that Connecticut rat-tail.”

“Ham against Japhet; I hope he’ll win.”

“Now,” said Brent, “that we’ve put in action Christ’s Golden Rule, Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence, and All-the-wisdom’s Preamble to the Constitution, we can sleep the sleep of well-doers, if we have two man-stealers — and one the brother of a murderer — only papered off from us.”</text>

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the Congress: 

It is a pleasure to return from whence I came. You are among my oldest friends in Washington--and this House is my oldest home. It was here, more than 14 years ago, that I first took the oath of Federal office. It was here, for 14 years, that I gained both knowledge and inspiration from members of both parties in both Houses--from your wise and generous leaders--and from the pronouncements which I can vividly recall, sitting where you now sit--including the programs of two great Presidents, the undimmed eloquence of Churchill, the soaring idealism of Nehru, the steadfast words of General de Gaulle. To speak from this same historic rostrum is a sobering experience. To be back among so many friends is a happy one. 

I am confident that that friendship will continue. Our Constitution wisely assigns both joint and separate roles to each branch of the government; and a President and a Congress who hold each other in mutual respect will neither permit nor attempt any trespass. For my part, I shall withhold from neither the Congress nor the people any fact or report, past, present, or future, which is necessary for an informed judgment of our conduct and hazards. I shall neither shift the burden of executive decisions to the Congress, nor avoid responsibility for the outcome of those decisions. 

I speak today in an hour of national peril and national opportunity. Before my term has ended, we shall have to test anew whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure. The outcome is by no means certain. The answers are by no means clear. All of us together--this Administration, this Congress, this nation-must forge those answers. 

But today, were I to offer--after little more than a week in office--detailed legislation to remedy every national ill, the Congress would rightly wonder whether the desire for speed had replaced the duty of responsibility. 

My remarks, therefore, will be limited. But they will also be candid. To state the facts frankly is not to despair the future nor indict the past. The prudent heir takes careful inventory of his legacies, and gives a faithful accounting to those whom he owes an obligation of trust. And, while the occasion does not call for another recital of our blessings and assets, we do have no greater asset than the willingness of a free and determined people, through its elected officials, to face all problems frankly and meet all dangers free from panic or fear. 

The present state of our economy is disturbing. We take office in the wake of seven months of recession, three and one-half years of slack, seven years of diminished economic growth, and nine years of falling farm income. 

Business bankruptcies have reached their highest level since the Great Depression. Since 1951 farm income has been squeezed down by 25 percent. Save for a brief period in 1958, insured unemployment is at the highest peak in our history. Of some five and one-half million Americans who are without jobs, more than one million have been searching for work for more than four months. And during each month some 150,000 workers are exhausting their already meager jobless benefit rights. 

Nearly, one-eighth of those who are without jobs live almost without hope in nearly one hundred especially depressed and troubled areas. The rest include new school graduates unable to use their talents, farmers forced to give up their part-time jobs which helped balance their family budgets, skilled and unskilled workers laid off in such important industries as metals, machinery, automobiles and apparel. 

Our recovery from the 1958 recession, moreover, was anemic and incomplete. Our Gross National Product never regained its full potential. Unemployment never returned to normal levels. Maximum use of our national industrial capacity was never restored. 

In short, the American economy is in trouble. The most resourceful industrialized country on earth ranks among the last in the rate of economic growth. Since last spring our economic growth rate has actually receded. Business investment is in a decline. Profits have fallen below predicted levels. Construction is off. A million unsold automobiles are in inventory. Fewer people are working--and the average work week has shrunk well below 40 hours. Yet prices have continued to rise--so that now too many Americans have less to spend for items that cost more to buy. 

Economic prophecy is at best an uncertain art--as demonstrated by the prediction one year ago from this same podium that 1960 would be, and I quote, &quot;the most prosperous year in our history.&quot; Nevertheless, forecasts of continued slack and only slightly reduced unemployment through 1961 and 1962 have been made with alarming unanimity-and this Administration does not intend to stand helplessly by. 

We cannot afford to waste idle hours and empty plants while awaiting the end of the recession. We must show the world what a free economy can do--to reduce unemployment, to put unused capacity to work, to spur new productivity, and to foster higher economic growth within a range of sound fiscal policies and relative price stability. 

I will propose to the Congress within the next 14 days measures to improve unemployment compensation through temporary increases in duration on a self-supporting basis--to provide more food for the families of the unemployed, and to aid their needy children--to redevelop our areas of chronic labor surplus--to expand the services of the U.S. Employment Offices--to stimulate housing and construction--to secure more purchasing power for our lowest paid workers by raising and expanding the minimum wage--to offer tax incentives for sound plant investment--to increase the development of our natural resources--to encourage price stability--and to take other steps aimed at insuring a prompt recovery and paving the way for increased long-range growth. This is not a partisan program concentrating on our weaknesses--it is, I hope, a national program to realize our national strength. 

II. 

Efficient expansion at home, stimulating the new plant and technology that can make our goods more competitive, is also the key to the international balance of payments problem. Laying aside all alarmist talk and panicky solutions, let us put that knotty problem in its proper perspective. 

It is true that, since 1958, the gap between the dollars we spend or invest abroad and the dollars returned to us has substantially widened. This overall deficit in our balance of payments increased by nearly $11 billion in the 3 years--and holders of dollars abroad converted them to gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly $5 billion of gold from our reserve. The 1959 deficit was caused in large part by the failure of our exports to penetrate foreign markets-the result both of restrictions on our goods and our own uncompetitive prices. The 1960 deficit, on the other hand, was more the result of an increase in private capital outflow seeking new opportunity, higher return or speculative advantage abroad. 

Meanwhile this country has continued to bear more than its share of the West's military and foreign aid obligations. Under existing policies, another deficit of $2 billion is predicted for 1961--and individuals in those countries whose dollar position once depended on these deficits for improvement now wonder aloud whether our gold reserves will remain sufficient to meet our own obligations. 

All this is cause for concern--but it is not cause for panic. For our monetary and financial position remains exceedingly strong. Including our drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and the gold reserve held as backing for our currency and Federal Reserve deposits, we have some $22 billion in total gold stocks and other international monetary reserves available-and I now pledge that their full strength stands behind the value of the dollar for use if needed. 

Moreover, we hold large assets abroad-the total owed this nation far exceeds the claims upon our reserves--and our exports once again substantially exceed our imports. 

In short, we need not--and we shall not-take any action to increase the dollar price of gold from $35 an ounce--to impose exchange controls--to reduce our anti-recession efforts--to fall back on restrictive trade policies--or to weaken our commitments around the world. 

This Administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any fashion. And this is a commitment. 

Prudence and good sense do require, however, that new steps be taken to ease the payments deficit and prevent any gold crisis. Our success in world affairs has long depended in part upon foreign confidence in our ability to pay. A series of executive orders, legislative remedies and cooperative efforts with our allies will get underway immediately--aimed at attracting foreign investment and travel to this country-promoting American exports, at stable prices and with more liberal government guarantees and financing--curbing tax and customs loopholes that encourage undue spending of private dollars abroad--and (through OECD, NATO and otherwise) sharing with our allies all efforts to provide for the common defense of the free world and the hopes for growth of the less developed lands. While the current deficit lasts, ways will be found to ease our dollar outlays abroad without placing the full burden on the families of men whom we have asked to serve our Flag overseas. 

In short, whatever is required will be done to back up all our efforts abroad, and to make certain that, in the future as in the past, the dollar is as &quot;sound as a dollar.&quot; 

III. 

But more than our exchange of international payments is out of balance. The current Federal budget for fiscal 1961 is almost certain to show a net deficit. The budget already submitted for fiscal 1962 will remain in balance only if the Congress enacts all the revenue measures requested--and only if an earlier and sharper up-turn in the economy than my economic advisers now think likely produces the tax revenues estimated. Nevertheless, a new Administration must of necessity build on the spending and revenue estimates already submitted. Within that framework, barring the development of urgent national defense needs or a worsening of the economy, it is my current intention to advocate a program of expenditures which, including revenues from a stimulation of the economy, will not of and by themselves unbalance the earlier Budget. 

However, we will do what must be done. For our national household is cluttered with unfinished and neglected tasks. Our cities are being engulfed in squalor. Twelve long years after Congress declared our goal to be &quot;a decent home and a suitable environment for every American family,&quot; we still have 25 million Americans living in substandard homes. A new housing program under a new Housing and Urban Affairs Department will be needed this year. 

Our classrooms contain 2 million more children than they can properly have room for, taught by 90,000 teachers not properly qualified to teach. One third of our most promising high school graduates are financially unable to continue the development of their talents. The war babies of the 1940's, who overcrowded our schools in the 1950's, are now descending in 1960 upon our colleges-with two college students for every one, ten years from now--and our colleges are ill prepared. We lack the scientists, the engineers and the teachers our world obligations require. We have neglected oceanography, saline water conversion, and the basic research that lies at the root of all progress. Federal grants for both higher and public school education can no longer be delayed. 

Medical research has achieved new wonders--but these wonders are too often beyond the reach of too many people, owing to a lack of income (particularly among the aged), a lack of hospital beds, a lack of nursing homes and a lack of doctors and dentists. Measures to provide health care for the aged under Social Security, and to increase the supply of both facilities and personnel, must be undertaken this year. 

Our supply of clean water is dwindling. Organized and juvenile crimes cost the taxpayers millions of dollars each year, making it essential that we have improved enforcement and new legislative safeguards. The denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of race--at the ballot box and elsewhere--disturbs the national conscience, and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage. Morality in private business has not been sufficiently spurred by morality in public business. A host of problems and projects in all 50 States, though not possible to include in this Message, deserves-and will receive--the attention of both the Congress and the Executive Branch. On most of these matters, Messages will be sent to the Congress within the next two weeks. 

IV. 

But all these problems pale when placed beside those which confront us around the world. No man entering upon this office, regardless of his party, regardless of his previous service in Washington, could fail to be staggered upon learning--even in this brief 10 day period--the harsh enormity of the trials through which we must pass in the next four years. Each day the crises multiply. Each day their solution grows more difficult. Each day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger, as weapons spread and hostile forces grow stronger. I feel I must inform the Congress that our analyses over the last ten days make it clear that--in each of the principal areas of crisis--the tide of events has been running out and time has not been our friend. 

In Asia, the relentless pressures of the Chinese Communists menace the security of the entire area--from the borders of India and South Viet Nam to the jungles of Laos, struggling to protect its newly-won independence. We seek in Laos what we seek in all Asia, and, indeed, in all of the world-freedom for the people and independence for the government. And this Nation shall persevere in our pursuit of these objectives. In Africa, the Congo has been brutally torn by civil strife, political unrest and public disorder. We shall continue to support the heroic efforts of the United Nations to restore peace and order--efforts which are now endangered by mounting tensions, unsolved problems, and decreasing support from many member states. 

In Latin America, Communist agents seeking to exploit that region's peaceful revolution of hope have established a base on Cuba, only 90 miles from our shores. Our objection with Cuba is not over the people's drive for a better life. Our objection is to their domination by foreign and domestic tyrannies. Cuban social and economic reform should be encouraged. Questions of economic and trade policy can always be negotiated. But Communist domination in this Hemisphere can never be negotiated. 

We are pledged to work with our sister republics to free the Americas of all such foreign domination and all tyranny, working toward the goal of a free hemisphere of free governments, extending from Cape Horn to the Arctic Circle. 

In Europe our alliances are unfulfilled and in some disarray. The unity of NATO has been weakened by economic rivalry and partially eroded by national interest. It has not yet fully mobilized its resources nor fully achieved a common outlook. Yet no Atlantic power can meet on its own the mutual problems now facing us in defense, foreign aid, monetary reserves, and a host of other areas; and our close ties with those whose hopes and interests we share are among this Nation's most powerful assets. 

Our greatest challenge is still the world that lies beyond the Cold War--but the first great obstacle is still our relations with the Soviet Union and Communist China. We must never be lulled into believing that either power has yielded its ambitions for world domination--ambitions which they forcefully restated only a short time ago. On the contrary, our task is to convince them that aggression and subversion will not be profitable routes to pursue these ends. Open and peaceful competition--for prestige, for markets, for scientific achievement, even for men's minds--is something else again. For if Freedom and Communism were to compete for man's allegiance in a world at peace, I would look to the future with ever increasing confidence. 

To meet this array of challenges--to fulfill the role we cannot avoid on the world scene--we must reexamine and revise our whole arsenal of tools: military, economic and political. 

One must not overshadow the other: On the Presidential Coat of Arms, the American eagle holds in his right talon the olive branch, while in his left he holds a bundle of arrows. We intend to give equal attention to both. 

First, we must strengthen our military tools. We are moving into a period of uncertain risk and great commitment in which both the military and diplomatic possibilities require a Free World force so powerful as to make any aggression clearly futile. Yet in the past, lack of a consistent, coherent military strategy, the absence of basic assumptions about our national requirements and the faulty estimates and duplication arising from inter-service rivalries have all made it difficult to assess accurately how adequate--or inadequate--our defenses really are. 

I have, therefore, instructed the Secretary of Defense to reappraise our entire defense strategy--our ability to fulfill our commitments-the effectiveness, vulnerability, and dispersal of our strategic bases, forces and warning systems--the efficiency and economy of our operation and organization-the elimination of obsolete bases and installations-and the adequacy, modernization and mobility of our present conventional and nuclear forces and weapons systems in the light of present and future dangers. I have asked for preliminary conclusions by the end of February--and I then shah recommend whatever legislative, budgetary or executive action is needed in the light of these conclusions. 

In the meantime, I have asked the Defense Secretary to initiate immediately three new steps most clearly needed now: 

First, l have directed prompt attention to increase our air-lift capacity. Obtaining additional air transport mobility--and obtaining it now--will better assure the ability of our conventional forces to respond, with discrimination and speed, to any problem at any spot on the globe at any moment's notice. In particular it will enable us to meet any deliberate effort to avoid or divert our forces by starting limited wars in widely scattered parts of the globe. 

(b) I have directed prompt action to step up our Polaris submarine program. Using unobligated ship-building funds now (to let contracts originally scheduled for the next fiscal year) will build and place on station--at least nine months earlier than planned-substantially more units of a crucial deterrent--a fleet that will never attack first, but possess sufficient powers of retaliation, concealed beneath the seas, to discourage any aggressor from launching an attack upon our security. 

(c) I have directed prompt action to accelerate our entire missile program. Until the Secretary of Defense's reappraisal is completed, the emphasis here will be largely on improved organization and decision making--on cutting down the wasteful duplications and the time-lag that have handicapped our whole family of missiles. If we are to keep the peace, we need an invulnerable missile force powerful enough to deter any aggressor from even threatening an attack that he would know could not destroy enough of our force to prevent his own destruction. For as I said upon taking the oath of office: &quot;Only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.&quot; 

Secondly, we must improve our economic tools. Our role is essential and unavoidable in the construction of a sound and expanding economy for the entire non-communist world, helping other nations build the strength to meet their own problems, to satisfy their own aspirations--to surmount their own dangers. The problems in achieving this goal are towering and unprecedented-the response must be towering and unprecedented as well, much as Lend-Lease and the Marshall Plan were in earlier years, which brought such fruitful results. 

(a) I intend to ask the Congress for authority to establish a new and more effective program for assisting the economic, educational and social development of other countries and continents. That program must stimulate and take more effectively into account the contributions of our allies, and provide central policy direction for all our own programs that now so often overlap, conflict or diffuse our energies and resources. Such a program, compared to past programs, will require 

--more flexibility for short run emergencies 

--more commitment to long term development --new attention to education at all levels  

--greater emphasis on the recipient nation's role, their effort, their purpose, with greater social justice for their people, broader distribution and participation by their people and more efficient public administration and more efficient tax systems of their own 

--and orderly planning for national and regional development instead of a piecemeal approach. 

I hope the Senate will take early action approving the Convention establishing the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This will be an important instrument in sharing with our allies this development effort--working toward the time when each nation will contribute in proportion to its ability to pay. For, while we are prepared to assume our full share of these huge burdens, we cannot and must not be expected to bear them alone. 

To our sister republics to the south, we have pledged a new alliance for progress-alianza para progreso. Our goal is a free and prosperous Latin America, realizing for all its states and all its citizens a degree of economic and social progress that matches their historic contributions of culture, intellect and liberty. To start this nation's role at this time in that alliance of neighbors, I am recommending the following: 

--That the Congress appropriate in full the $500 million fund pledged by the Act of Bogota, to be used not as an instrument of the Cold War, but as a first step in the sound development of the Americas. 

--That a new Inter-Departmental Task Force be established under the leadership of the Department of State, to coordinate at the highest level all policies and programs of concern to the Americas. 

--That our delegates to the OAS, working with those of other members, strengthen that body as an instrument to preserve the peace and to prevent foreign domination anywhere in the Hemisphere. 

--That, in cooperation with other nations, we launch a new hemispheric attack on illiteracy and inadequate educational opportunities to all levels; and, finally, 

--That a Food-for-Peace mission be sent immediately to Latin America to explore ways in which our vast food abundance can be used to help end hunger and malnutrition in certain areas of suffering in our own hemisphere. 

This Administration is expanding its Food-for-Peace Program in every possible way. The product of our abundance must be used more effectively to relieve hunger and help economic growth in all corners of the globe. And I have asked the Director of this Program to recommend additional ways in which these surpluses can advance the interests of world peace--including the establishment of world food reserves. 

An even more valuable national asset is our reservoir of dedicated men and women-not only on our college campuses but in every age group--who have indicated their desire to contribute their skills, their efforts, and a part of their lives to the fight for world order. We can mobilize this talent through the formation of a National Peace Corps, enlisting the services of all those with the desire and capacity to help foreign lands meet their urgent needs for trained personnel. 

Finally, while our attention is centered on the development of the noncommunist world, we must never forget our hopes for the ultimate freedom and welfare of the Eastern European peoples. In order to be prepared to help re-establish historic ties of friendship, I am asking the Congress for increased discretion to use economic tools in this area whenever this is found to be clearly in the national interest. This will require amendment of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act along the lines I proposed as a member of the Senate, and upon which the Senate voted last summer. Meanwhile, I hope to explore with the Polish government the possibility of using our frozen Polish funds on projects of peace that will demonstrate our abiding friendship for and interest in the people of Poland. 

Third, we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tools the means of cooperation and agreement on which an enforceable world order must ultimately rest. 

I have already taken steps to coordinate and expand our disarmament effort--to increase our programs of research and study-and to make arms control a central goal of our national policy under my direction. The deadly arms race, and the huge resources it absorbs, have too long overshadowed all else we must do. We must prevent that arms race from spreading to new nations, to new nuclear powers and to the reaches of outer space. We must make certain that our negotiators are better informed and better prepared--to formulate workable proposals of our own and to make sound judgments about the proposals of others. 

I have asked the other governments concerned to agree to a reasonable delay in the talks on a nuclear test ban--and it is our intention to resume negotiations prepared to reach a final agreement with any nation that is equally willing to agree to an effective and enforceable treaty. 

We must increase our support of the United Nations as an instrument to end the Cold War instead of an arena in which to fight it. In recognition of its increasing importance and the doubling of its membership 

--we are enlarging and strengthening our own mission to the U.N. 

--we shall help insure that it is properly financed. 

--we shall work to see that the integrity of the office of the Secretary-General is maintained. 

--And I would address a special plea to the smaller nations of the world--to join with us in strengthening this organization, which is far more essential to their security than it is to ours--the only body in the world where no nation need be powerful to be secure, where every nation has an equal voice, and where any nation can exert influence not according to the strength of its armies but according to the strength of its ideas. It deserves the support of all. 

Finally, this Administration intends to explore promptly all possible areas of cooperation with the Soviet Union and other nations &quot;to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors.&quot; Specifically, I now invite all nations--including the Soviet Union--to join with us in developing a weather prediction program, in a new communications satellite program and in preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus, probes which may someday unlock the deepest secrets of the universe. 

Today this country is ahead in the science and technology of space, while the Soviet Union is ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicles into orbit. Both nations would help themselves as well as other nations by ten moving these endeavors from the bitter and wasteful competition of the Cold War. The United States would be willing to join with the Soviet Union and the scientists of all nations in a greater effort to make the fruits of this new knowledge available to all-and, beyond that, in an effort to extend farm technology to hungry nations--to wipe out disease--to increase the exchanges of scientists and. their knowledge--and to make our own laboratories available to technicians of other lands who lack the facilities to pursue their own work. Where nature makes natural allies of us all, we can demonstrate that beneficial relations are possible even with those with whom we most deeply disagree-and this must someday be the basis of world peace and world law. 

V. 

I have commented on the state of the domestic economy, our balance of payments, our Federal and social budget and the state of the world. I would like to conclude with a few remarks about the state of the Executive branch. We have found it full of honest and useful public servants--but their capacity to act decisively at the exact time action is needed has too often been muffled in the morass of committees, timidities and fictitious theories which have created a growing gap between decision and execution, between planning and reality. In a time of rapidly deteriorating situations at home and abroad, this is bad for the public service and particularly bad for the country; and we mean to make a change. 

I have pledged myself and my colleagues in the cabinet to a continuous encouragement of initiative, responsibility and energy in serving the public interest. Let every public servant know, whether his post is high or low, that a man's rank and reputation in this Administration will be determined by the size of the job he does, and not by the size of his staff, his office or his budget. Let it be clear that this Administration recognizes the value of dissent and daring--that we greet healthy controversy as the hallmark of healthy change. Let the public service be a proud and lively career. And let every man and woman who works in any area of our national government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say with pride and with honor in future years: &quot;I served the United States government in that hour of our nation's need.&quot; 

For only with complete dedication by us all to the national interest can we bring our country through the troubled years that lie ahead. Our problems are critical. The tide is unfavorable. The news will be worse before it is better. And while hoping and working for the best, we should prepare ourselves now for the worst. 

We cannot escape our dangers--neither must we let them drive us into panic or narrow isolation. In many areas of the world where the balance of power already rests with our adversaries, the forces of freedom are sharply divided. It is one of the ironies of our time that the techniques of a harsh and repressive system should be able to instill discipline and ardor in its servants--. while the blessings of liberty have too often stood for privilege, materialism and a life of case. 

But I have a different view of liberty. 

Life in 1961 will not be easy. Wishing it, predicting it, even asking for it, will not make it so. There will be further setbacks before the tide is turned. But turn it we must. The hopes of all mankind rest upon us--not simply upon those of us in this chamber, but upon the peasant in Laos, the fisherman in Nigeria, the exile from Cuba, the spirit that moves every man and Nation who shares our hopes for freedom and the future. And in the final analysis, they rest most of all upon the pride and perseverance of our fellow citizens of the great Republic. 

In the words of a great President, whose birthday we honor today, closing his final State of the Union Message sixteen years ago, &quot;We pray that we may be worthy of the unlimited opportunities that God has given us.&quot;

==Chapter XXIX==
===Thalatta!  Thalatta!===
When I came to myself, I was stretched in half darkness, covered with thick coats and blankets. My uncle was watching over me, to discover the least sign of life. At my first sigh he took my hand; when I opened my eyes he uttered a cry of joy.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;He lives! he lives!&quot; he cried.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Yes, I am still alive,&quot; I answered feebly.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;My dear nephew,&quot; said my uncle, pressing me to his breast, &quot;you are saved.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I was deeply touched with the tenderness of his manner as he uttered these words, and still more with the care with which he watched over me. But such trials were wanted to bring out the Professor's tenderer qualities.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
At this moment Hans came, he saw my hand in my uncle's, and I may safely say that there was joy in his countenance.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;''God dag,''&quot; said he.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;How do you do, Hans? How are you? And now, uncle, tell me where we are at the present moment?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;To-morrow, Axel, to-morrow. Now you are too faint and weak. I have bandaged your head with compresses which must not be disturbed. Sleep now, and to-morrow I will tell you all.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;But do tell me what time it is, and what day.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;It is Sunday, the 8th of August, and it is ten at night. You must ask me no more questions until the 10th.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
In truth I was very weak, and my eyes involuntarily closed. I wanted a good night's rest; and I therefore went off to sleep, with the knowledge that I had been four long days alone in the heart of the earth.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Next morning, on awakening, I looked round me. My couch, made up of all our travelling gear, was in a charming grotto, adorned with splendid stalactites, and the soil of which was a fine sand. It was half light. There was no torch, no lamp, yet certain mysterious glimpses of light came from without through a narrow opening in the grotto. I heard too a vague and indistinct noise, something like the murmuring of waves breaking upon a shingly shore, and at times I seemed to hear the whistling of wind.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I wondered whether I was awake, whether I dreaming, whether my brain, crazed by my fall, was not affected by imaginary noises. Yet neither eyes, nor ears could be so utterly deceived.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
It is a ray of daylight, I thought, sliding in through this cleft in the rock! That is indeed the murmuring of waves! That is the rustling noise of wind. Am I quite mistaken, or have we returned to the surface of the earth? Has my uncle given up the expedition, or is it happily terminated?
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I was asking myself these unanswerable questions when the Professor entered.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Good morning, Axel,&quot; he cried cheerily. &quot;I feel sure you are better.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Yes, I am indeed,&quot; said I, sitting up on my couch.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;You can hardly fail to be better, for you have slept quietly. Hans and I watched you by turns, and we have noticed you were evidently recovering.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Indeed, I do feel a great deal better, and I will give you a proof of that presently if you will let me have my breakfast.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;You shall eat, lad. The fever has left you. Hans rubbed your wounds with some ointment or other of which the Icelanders keep the secret, and they have healed marvellously. Our hunter is a splendid fellow!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Whilst he went on talking, my uncle prepared a few provisions, which I devoured eagerly, notwithstanding his advice to the contrary. All the while I was overwhelming him with questions which he answered readily.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I then learnt that my providential fall had brought me exactly to the extremity of an almost perpendicular shaft; and as I had landed in the midst of an accompanying torrent of stones, the least of which would have been enough to crush me, the conclusion was that a loose portion of the rock had come down with me. This frightful conveyance had thus carried me into the arms of my uncle, where I fell bruised, bleeding, and insensible.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Truly it is wonderful that you have not been killed a hundred times over. But, for the love of God, don't let us ever separate again, or we many never see each other more.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Not separate! Is the journey not over, then?&quot; I opened a pair of astonished eyes, which immediately called for the question:
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;What is the matter, Axel?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;I have a question to ask you. You say that I am safe and sound?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;No doubt you are.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;And all my limbs unbroken?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Certainly.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;And my head?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Your head, except for a few bruises, is all right; and it is on your shoulders, where it ought to be.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Well, I am afraid my brain is affected.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Your mind affected!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Yes, I fear so. Are we again on the surface of the globe?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;No, certainly not.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Then I must be mad; for don't I see the light of day, and don't I hear the wind blowing, and the sea breaking on the shore?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Ah! is that all?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Do tell me all about it.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;I can't explain the inexplicable, but you will soon see and understand that geology has not yet learnt all it has to learn.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Then let us go,&quot; I answered quickly.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;No, Axel; the open air might be bad for you.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Open air?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Yes; the wind is rather strong. You must not expose yourself.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;But I assure you I am perfectly well.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;A little patience, my nephew. A relapse might get us into trouble, and we have no time to lose, for the voyage may be a long one.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;The voyage!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Yes, rest to-day, and to-morrow we will set sail.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&quot;Set sail!&quot; — and I almost leaped up.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
What did it all mean? Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon? Was there a ship at our disposal in some underground harbour?
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
My curiosity was highly excited, my uncle vainly tried to restrain me. When he saw that my impatience was doing me harm, he yielded.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I dressed in haste. For greater safety I wrapped myself in a blanket, and came out of the grotto.
&lt;/div&gt;

This cause has its origin in the case decided in this Court between ''Watts'' and ''Massie'', in the year 1810.

That suit came up from the Kentucky District, and was prosecuted there because Massie, the defendant, then resided in that State, and either was, or was supposed to be, actually seised of the land in question.

Since that decision, it has been ascertained that the present defendants are in possession of the land, or the greater part of it; and Massie also having changed his residence to Ohio, this suit has become necessary, both to enforce the former decree against him, and to obtain relief against the actual possessors of the land.

In the course of discussion, the Court has been called on to review its decision in ''Watts'' and ''Massie'', and it has patiently heard, and deliberately considered, the able and well-conducted argument on this subject. But, after the maturest reflection, it adheres to the opinion that, whether the case be viewed with reference to the time, intent, and meaning of the calls, to analogy to decided cases, or convenience in the voluntary adoption of a principle of the most general application; that laid down in the case of ''Watts'' and ''Massie'', for running the lines of the land called for, cannot be deviated from. So far, therefore, as Massie himself, and his privies in estate, are concerned, Watts is now entitled to the full benefit of that decision.

But there are various other defendants, and several grounds of defence assumed in this case, which are unaffected by the decision referred to.

It is contended, in the first place, that there is a radical defect of parties. That the representatives of O'Neal and Scott, through whom the complainant claims, and those of Powell and Thomas Massie, supposed to be hostile to his interests, ought to have been made parties.

On this point there may be given one general answer. No one need be made a party complainant in whom there exists no in rest, and no one party defendant from whom nothing is demanded. Watts rests his case upon the averment that all the interests once vested in O'Neal and the Scots, now centre in himself, and, provided he can recover the land now in possession of those actually made defendants, he is contented afterwards to meet the just claims of any others who are not made defendants. No rights will be affected by his recovery, but those of the actual defendants, and those claiming through them. As to the supposed interference of the lines ordered to be surveyed, with those of Thomas Massie, or Powell, the former is merely hypothetical by way of reference, or imaginary; and the latter is only asserted on the ground that Massie had acquired all the interest in Powell's survey that Powell ever had. There was therefore nothing to demand of Powell, as the case is exhibited by the record. It must be subject to these modifications, that the ''obiter dictum'' of the Court, in the case of ''Simms'' and ''Guthrie'', is to be understood.

It is next contended, in behalf of Kerr, and several other defendants, that they claim through purchasers who were ''bona fide'' purchasers without notice, for a valuable consideration. And at first view it would seem, that the principles so often applied to the relief of innocent purchasers, are applicable to the case of these defendants, wherever the facts sustain the defence. But it will not do at this day, to apply this principle to the case of purchasers of military land-warrants, derived under the laws of Virginia. In all the Courts in which such cases have come under review, the purchasers have been considered as affected by the record notice of the entry, and also of the survey, such as it legally ought to be made, as incident to, or bound up in the entry. It is altogether a system ''sui generis'', and subsequent purchasers are considered as acquiring the interest of the entror, and not necessarily that of the State. So that purchasers under conflicting entries are considered as purchasing under distinct rights, in which case the principle here contended for does not apply; since the ignorance of a purchaser of a defective title, cannot make that title good, as against an independent and better right. These principles may safely be laid hold of, to support a doctrine which, however severe occasionally in its operation, was perhaps indispensable to the protection of the interests acquired under military land-warrants, when we take into consideration the facility with which such interests might otherwise, in all cases, have been defeated by early transfers.

It is further contended, that the defendants are not bound by the decree in the case of ''Watts'' and ''Massie'', because neither parties, nor privies, nor ''pendente lite'' purchasers.

That those who come not into this Court, in any one of those characters, are not subject to the direct and binding efficacy of an adjudication, is unquestionable. But it is not very material as to the principal question in this case, whether the parties are to be affected by the former adjudication directly, or by the declared adherence of this Court to the doctrines established in that case. The consequence to the parties on the merits of the case is the same.

But in one view it is material, and that is with regard to the proof of the exhibits, through which Watts, the complainant, deduces his title through the Scots from O'Neal. As Massie, in the former case, (the record of which is made a proof of this,) acquiesced in this deduction of Watts' title, we are of opinion that it is, as to him and his privies in estate, a point conceded. As to parties and privies, the principle cannot be contested; and as to ''pendente lite'' purchasers, it is not necessary to determine the question, since the only defendants who have appealed from the decision below, to wit, Kerr, the Kirkpatricks, Doolittle, and the Johnsons, claim under purchases made long anterior to this scrip, in Kentucky.

Those defendants certainly were entitled to a plenary defence, and where they have, by their answers, put the complainant upon proof of his allegations, as to his deduction of title, the question arises, whether it appears from the record that the deduction of title was legally proved.

There can be no doubt that this question passed ''sub silentio'' in the Court below, but it does not appear from any thing on the record, that the point was waived; and we are not at liberty to look beyond the record for the evidence on which the deduction of title was sustained.

Although we entertain no doubt, that exhibits may, on the trial, be proved by parol testimony, yet a note on the minutes, or on the exhibit, became indispensable to transmit the fact to this Court; and as the case furnishes no such memorandum, we must consider the assignments through which Watts derived his title from O'Neal, as not having been established by evidence. Such was the decision of this Court in the case of ''Drummond'' v. ''M'Gruder''.

But Kerr is the only one of these appellants who has expressly put the complainant on proof of his title. The rest of the appellants having passed over this subject without any notice in their answer, the question is, whether they waived their right to call for evidence to prove these exhibits. We are of opinion they have not; and that the complainant is always bound to prove his title, unless it be admitted by the answer.

There are two principles of a more general nature, of which all the appellants claim the benefit, and which, as the cause must go back, will require consideration.

It is contended, that Nathaniel Massie was the acknowledged agent of both O'Neal and Watts, and that the complainant is precluded by his acts done in that capacity. This argument is resorted to, as well to fasten on Watts the survey made in his behalf above the town of Chilicothe, as a relinquishment of all claim to a location at the place now contended for in his behalf. But in neither of these views can this Court apply this principle in favour of the defendants; for, it follows from the principles established for surveying O'Neal's entry, that the survey made by Massie on O'Neal's entry, was illegal and void; and, certainly, when employed in locating the entries made in favour of Powell and himself, Massie was not acting as the agent of O'Neal or Watts, but as the agent of Powell, or, in fact, in his own behalf. The survey, on which this argument rests, was at best but partial; and it is conclusive against it to observe, that the powers of Massie, as agent of Watts, were limited to the entry and mechanical acts of the survey. The recording of that survey, and all those solemn acts which give it legal validity, it does not appear that his powers extended to. Watts never recognised that survey, or assumed the obligatory effects of it by any act of his own, and in fact, in the event, (though not a material circumstance to the result we come to,) it has since been ascertained that it was not only made off Watts's entry, but on land appropriated by another.

But it has been contended, also, that all these surveys actually made on the military land warrants of Virginia, derive the authenticity and force of judicial acts, or of acts done by the general agents of the continental officers respectively, from the superintending and controlling powers vested in the deputations of officers, as the law denominates them, appointed by themselves to superintend the appropriation of the military reserves set apart for their use. It is to be presumed, it is contended, that every survey made by their authorized surveyors, was made under their control and direction. This Court does not feel itself authorized to raise any such presumption. The powers actually exercised by those commissioners, were limited to very few objects. The surveying of entries at a very early period, became a judicial subject. And the commissioners, or rather deputations of officers, never assumed a right to adjust the conflicting interests of individuals upon the locating and surveying of such entries. To appoint surveyors, to superintend and direct the drawing of lots for precedence among the locators, to direct the survey for officers and soldiers not present or not represented, and to determine when the good lands bet veen the Cumberland and Tennessee should be exhausted, comprehended all the powers with which they were vested. As individual agents capable of binding their principals, they appear in one case, and only one, which was when the officer or soldier was absent and unrepresented. And as to judicial powers, there is no provision of the act that vests them with a semblance of such a power, unless it be to judge of the right of priority as determined by lot. But here, also, they appear more properly in the character of ministerial officers discharging a duty without the least latitude of judgment or discretion. Their powers in nothing resemble that of the Courts of Commissioners established through the back counties of Virginia. As to the subjects submitted to the boards so constituted, (of which military warrants were no part,) those boards were expressly vested with judicial power. But the powers of the deputations of officers were purely ministerial. And if it be admitted, that they might have exercised the power of defining the principles on which surveys should have been made, yet it is certainly incumbent on him who would avail himself of that power, to show that it was exercised, and to bring himself within the rules prescribed by their authority.

Decree reversed as to these appellants, and sent back for further proceedings.

At moments in the midst of this confusion, Hal found himself trying to recall who had worked in Number One, among the people he knew. He himself had been employed in Number Two, so he had naturally come to know more men in that mine. But he had known some from the other mine--Old Rafferty for one, and Mary Burke's father for another, and at least one of the members of his check-weighman group--Zamierowski. Hal saw in a sudden vision the face of this patient little man, who smiled so good-naturedly while Americans were trying to say his name. And Old Rafferty, with all his little Rafferties, and his piteous efforts to keep the favour of his employers! And poor Patrick Burke, whom Hal had never seen sober; doubtless he was sober now, if he was still alive!

Then in the crowd Hal encountered Jerry Minetti, and learned that another man who had been down was Farenzena, the Italian whose &quot;fanciulla&quot; had played with him; and yet another was Judas Apostolikas--having taken his thirty pieces of silver with him into the deathtrap!

People were making up lists, just as Hal was doing, by asking questions of others. These lists were subject to revision--sometimes under dramatic circumstances. You saw a woman weeping, with her apron to her eyes; suddenly she would look up, give a piercing cry, and fling her arms about the neck of some man. As for Hal, he felt as if he were encountering a ghost when suddenly he recognised Patrick Burke, standing in the midst of a group of people. He went over and heard the old man's story--how there was a Dago fellow who had stolen his timbers, and he had come up to the surface for more; so his life had been saved, while the timber-thief was down there still--a judgment of Providence upon mine-miscreants!

Presently Hal asked if Burke had been to tell his family. He had run home, he said, but there was nobody there. So Hal began pushing his way through the throngs, looking for Mary, or her sister Jennie, or her brother Tommie. He persisted in this search, although it occurred to him to wonder whether the family of a hopeless drunkard would appreciate the interposition of Providence in his behalf.

He encountered Olson, who had had a narrow escape, being employed as a surface-man near the hoist. All this was an old story to the organiser, who had worked in mines since he was eight years old, and had seen many kinds of disaster. He began to explain things to Hal, in a matter of fact way. The law required a certain number of openings to every mine, also an escape-way with ladders by which men could come out; but it cost good money to dig holes in the ground.

At this time the immediate cause of the explosion was unknown, but they could tell it was a &quot;dust explosion&quot; by the clouds of coke-dust, and no one who had been into the mine and seen its dry condition would doubt what they would find when they went down and traced out the &quot;force&quot; and its effects. They were supposed to do regular sprinkling, but in such matters the bosses used their own judgment.

Hal was only half listening to these explanations. The thing was too raw and too horrible to him. What difference did it make whose fault it was? The accident had happened, and the question was now how to meet the emergency! Underneath Olson's sentences he heard the cry of men and boys being asphyxiated in dark dungeons--he heard the wailing of women, like a surf beating on a distant shore, or the faint, persistent accompaniment of muted strings: &quot;O, mein Mann! O, mein Mann!&quot;

They came upon Jeff Cotton again. With half a dozen men to help him, he was pushing back the crowd from the pit-mouth, and stretching barbed wired to hold them back. He was none too gentle about it, Hal thought; but doubtless women are provoking when they are hysterical. He was answering their frenzied questions, &quot;Yes, yes! We're getting a new fan. We're doing everything we can, I tell you. We'll get them out. Go home and wait.&quot;

But of course no one would go home. How could a woman sit in her house, or go about her ordinary tasks of cooking or washing, while her man might be suffering asphyxiation under the ground? The least she could do was to stand at the pit-mouth--as near to him as she could get! Some of them stood motionless, hour after hour, while others wandered through the village streets, asking the same people, over and over again, if they had seen their loved ones. Several had turned up, like Patrick Burke; there seemed always a chance for one more.</text>

--      with a few improvements: all namespaces and all namespace aliases     --

--      the local wiki. This module requires [[Module:Namespace detect]]      --
--      and [[Module:Yesno]] to be available on the local wiki. It can be     --
--      configured for different wikis by altering the values in              --
--      [[Module:Category handler/config]], and pages can be blacklisted      --
--      from categorisation by using [[Module:Category handler/blacklist]].   --

This module is intended to provide access to basic string functions.

Most of the functions provided here can be invoked with named parameters, 
unnamed parameters, or a mixture.  If named parameters are used, Mediawiki will 
automatically remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the parameter.  
Depending on the intended use, it may be advantageous to either preserve or
remove such whitespace.

Global options
    ignore_errors: If set to 'true' or 1, any error condition will result in 
        an empty string being returned rather than an error message.  
        
    error_category: If an error occurs, specifies the name of a category to 
        include with the error message.  The default category is  
        [Category:Errors reported by Module String].
        
    no_category: If set to 'true' or 1, no category will be added if an error
        is generated.
        
Unit tests for this module are available at Module:String/tests.

--[[
len

This function returns the length of the target string.

Usage:
{{#invoke:String|len|target_string|}}
OR
{{#invoke:String|len|s=target_string}}

Parameters
    s: The string whose length to report

If invoked using named parameters, Mediawiki will automatically remove any leading or
trailing whitespace from the target string.  
]]
function str.len( frame )
    local new_args = str._getParameters( frame.args, {'s'} );
    local s = new_args['s'] or '';
    return mw.ustring.len( s )
end

--[[
sub

This function returns a substring of the target string at specified indices.

Usage:
{{#invoke:String|sub|target_string|start_index|end_index}}
OR
{{#invoke:String|sub|s=target_string|i=start_index|j=end_index}}

Parameters
    s: The string to return a subset of
    i: The fist index of the substring to return, defaults to 1.
    j: The last index of the string to return, defaults to the last character.
    
The first character of the string is assigned an index of 1.  If either i or j
is a negative value, it is interpreted the same as selecting a character by 
counting from the end of the string.  Hence, a value of -1 is the same as 
selecting the last character of the string.

If the requested indices are out of range for the given string, an error is 
reported.

end

--[[
match

This function returns a substring from the source string that matches a 
specified pattern.

Usage:
{{#invoke:String|match|source_string|pattern_string|start_index|match_number|plain_flag|nomatch_output}}
OR
{{#invoke:String|match|s=source_string|pattern=pattern_string|start=start_index
    |match=match_number|plain=plain_flag|nomatch=nomatch_output}}

Parameters
    s: The string to search
    pattern: The pattern or string to find within the string
    start: The index within the source string to start the search.  The first
        character of the string has index 1.  Defaults to 1.
    match: In some cases it may be possible to make multiple matches on a single 
        string.  This specifies which match to return, where the first match is 
        match= 1.  If a negative number is specified then a match is returned 
        counting from the last match.  Hence match = -1 is the same as requesting
        the last match.  Defaults to 1.
    plain: A flag indicating that the pattern should be understood as plain
        text.  Defaults to false.
    nomatch: If no match is found, output the &quot;nomatch&quot; value rather than an error.

If invoked using named parameters, Mediawiki will automatically remove any leading or
trailing whitespace from each string.  In some circumstances this is desirable, in 
other cases one may want to preserve the whitespace.

If the match_number or start_index are out of range for the string being queried, then
this function generates an error.  An error is also generated if no match is found.
If one adds the parameter ignore_errors=true, then the error will be suppressed and 
an empty string will be returned on any failure.

pos

This function returns a single character from the target string at position pos.

Usage:
{{#invoke:String|pos|target_string|index_value}}
OR
{{#invoke:String|pos|target=target_string|pos=index_value}}

Parameters
    target: The string to search
    pos: The index for the character to return

If invoked using named parameters, Mediawiki will automatically remove any leading or
trailing whitespace from the target string.  In some circumstances this is desirable, in 
other cases one may want to preserve the whitespace.

The first character has an index value of 1.

If one requests a negative value, this function will select a character by counting backwards 
from the end of the string.  In other words pos = -1 is the same as asking for the last character.

A requested value of zero, or a value greater than the length of the string returns an error.

str_find

This function duplicates the behavior of {{str_find}}, including all of its quirks.
This is provided in order to support existing templates, but is NOT RECOMMENDED for 
new code and templates.  New code is recommended to use the &quot;find&quot; function instead.

Returns the first index in &quot;source&quot; that is a match to &quot;target&quot;.  Indexing is 1-based,
and the function returns -1 if the &quot;target&quot; string is not present in &quot;source&quot;.

Important Note: If the &quot;target&quot; string is empty / missing, this function returns a
value of &quot;1&quot;, which is generally unexpected behavior, and must be accounted for
separatetly.

find

This function allows one to search for a target string or pattern within another
string.

Usage:
{{#invoke:String|find|source_str|target_string|start_index|plain_flag}}
OR
{{#invoke:String|find|source=source_str|target=target_str|start=start_index|plain=plain_flag}}

Parameters
    source: The string to search
    target: The string or pattern to find within source
    start: The index within the source string to start the search, defaults to 1
    plain: Boolean flag indicating that target should be understood as plain
        text and not as a Lua style regular expression, defaults to true

If invoked using named parameters, Mediawiki will automatically remove any leading or
trailing whitespace from the parameter.  In some circumstances this is desirable, in 
other cases one may want to preserve the whitespace.

This function returns the first index &gt;= &quot;start&quot; where &quot;target&quot; can be found 
within &quot;source&quot;.  Indices are 1-based.  If &quot;target&quot; is not found, then this 
function returns 0.  If either &quot;source&quot; or &quot;target&quot; are missing / empty, this
function also returns 0.

This function should be safe for UTF-8 strings.

''XVI. To Bishop
Iren&amp;#230;us.''&lt;ref&gt;
cf.
Epp. iii, xii, and xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is nothing good, it seems,
in prospect for us, so, far from calming down, the tempest troubling
the Church seems to rise higher every day. The conveners of the Council
have arrived and delivered the letters of summons to several of the
Metropolitans including our own, and I have sent a copy of the letter
to your Holiness to acquaint you how, as the poet has it, &amp;#8220;Woe
has been welded by woe.&amp;#8221;&lt;ref&gt;
Homer II. xvi. iii. &amp;#954;&amp;#945;&amp;#954;&amp;#8056;&amp;#957; &amp;#954;&amp;#945;&amp;#954;&amp;#8183;
&amp;#7952;&amp;#963;&amp;#964;&amp;#8053;&amp;#961;&amp;#953;&amp;#954;&amp;#964;&amp;#959;. For Theodoret&amp;#8217;s knowledge of Homer cf. pp. 104 and
258.&lt;/ref&gt; And we need only
the Lord&amp;#8217;s goodness to stay the storm. Easy it is for Him to stay
it, but we are unworthy of the calm, yet the grace of His patience is
enough for us, so that haply by it we may get the better of our foes.
So the divine apostle has taught us to pray &amp;#8220;for He will with the
temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear
it.&amp;#8221;&lt;ref&gt;
1 Cor. x. 13&lt;/ref&gt; But I beseech your godliness to
stop the mouths of the objectors and make them understand that it is
not for them who stand, as the phrase goes, out of range, to scoff at
men fighting in the ranks and giving and receiving blows; for what
matters it what weapon the soldier uses to strike down his antagonists?
Even the great David did not use a panoply when he slew the
aliens&amp;#8217; champion,&lt;ref&gt;
1 Sam. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; and Samson slew
thousands on one day with the jawbone of an ass.&lt;ref&gt;
Judges xv. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody grumbles at the victory, nor
accuses the conqueror of cowardice, because he wins it without
brandishing a spear or covering himself with his shield or throwing
darts or shooting arrows. The defenders of true religion must be
criticized in the same way, nor must we try to find language which will
stir strife, but rather arguments which plainly proclaim the truth and
make those who venture to oppose it ashamed of themselves.

What does it matter whether we
style the holy Virgin at the same time mother of Man and mother of God,
or call her mother and servant of her offspring, with the addition that
she is mother of our Lord Jesus Christ as man, but His servant as God,
and so at once avoid the term which is the pretext of calumny, and express the
same opinion by another phrase? And besides this it must also be borne
in mind that the former of these titles is of general use, and the
latter peculiar to the Virgin; and that it is about this that all the
controversy has arisen, which would God had never been. The majority of
the old Fathers have applied the more honourable title to the Virgin,
as your Holiness yourself has done in two or three discourses; several
of these, which your godliness sent to me, I have in my own possession,
and in these you have not coupled the title mother of Man with mother
of God, but have explained its meaning by the use of other words. But
since you find fault with me for having left out the holy and blessed
Fathers Diodorus and Theodorus in my list of authorities, I have
thought it necessary to add a few words on this point.

In the first place, my dear
friend, I have omitted many others both famous and illustrious.
Secondly this fact must be borne in mind, that the accused party is
bound to produce unimpeachable witnesses, whose testimony even his
accusers cannot impugn. But if the defendant were to call into court
authorities accused by the prosecutors, even the judge himself would
not consent to receive them. If I had omitted these holy men in
compiling an eulogy of the Fathers, I should, I own, have been wrong,
and should have proved myself ungrateful to my teachers. But if when
under accusation I have brought forward a defence, and have produced
unimpeachable witnesses, why do men who are unwilling to see any of
these testimonies lay me under unreasonable blame? How I reverence
these writers is sufficiently shewn by my own book in their behalf, in
which I have refuted the indictment laid against them, without fear of
the influence of their accusers or even of the secret attack made upon
myself. These people who are so fond of foolish talk had better get
some other excuse for their sleight of words. My object is not to make
my words and deeds fit the pleasure of this man or that man, but to
edify the church of God, and please her bridegroom and Lord. I call my
conscience to witness that I am not acting as I do through care of
material things, nor because I cling to the honour with all its cares,
which I shrink from calling an unhappy one. I would long ago have
withdrawn of my own accord, did I not fear the judgment of God. And now
know well that I await my fate. And I think that it is drawing near,
for so the plots against me indicate.&lt;ref&gt;
This letter appears to be written shortly before the meeting of
the Robber Synod in 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon
IX.

The members of the Church are
not allowed to meet in the cemeteries, nor attend the so-called
martyries of any of the heretics, for prayer or service; but such as so
do, if they be communicants, shall be excommunicated for a time; but if
they repent and confess that they have sinned they shall be
received.

Notes.

Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

Whoso prayeth in the cemeteries and martyries of
heretics is to be excommunicated.

Zonaras.

By the word &amp;#8220;service&amp;#8221; (&amp;#952;&amp;#949;&amp;#961;&amp;#945;&amp;#960;&amp;#949;&amp;#8055;&amp;#945;&amp;#962;)
in this canon is to be understood the healing of sickness.&amp;#160; The
canon wishes that the faithful should under no pretence betake
themselves to the prayers of heretical pseudo-martyrs nor pay them
honour in the hope of obtaining the healing of sickness or the cure of
their various temptations.&amp;#160; And if any do so, they are to be cut
off, that is for a time forbidden communion (and this refers to the
faithful who are only laymen), but when they have done penance and made
confession of their fault, the canon orders that they are to be
received back again.

Balsamon.

As canon vi. forbids heretics to enter the house of God,
so this canon forbids the faithful to go to the cemeteries of heretics,
which are called by them &amp;#8220;Martyries.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;For in the days
of the persecution, certain of the heretics, calling themselves
Christians, suffered even to death, and hence those who shared their
opinions called them &amp;#8220;martyrs.&amp;#8221;

Van Espen.

As Catholics had their martyrs, so too had the heretics,
and especially the Montanists or Phrygians, who greatly boasted of
them.&amp;#160; Apollinaris writes of these as may be seen in Eusebius
(''H. E.'', Lib. v., cap. xvj.)

The places or cemeteries in which rested the bodies of
those they boasted of as martyrs, they styled &amp;#8220;Martyries&amp;#8221;
(''martyria'') as similar places among Catholics were wont to be
called by the same name, from the bones of the martyrs that rested
there.

From the Greek text, as also from Isidore&amp;#8217;s
version it is clear that this canon refers to all the faithful
generally, and that &amp;#8220;the members of the Church&amp;#8221; (Lat.
''Ecclesiastici'', the word Dionysius uses) must be taken in this
wide signification.</text>

Chapter 6.&amp;#8212;Reply is Made to the Cavils of the Heretics
in Respect to the Same Words Begotten and Unbegotten.

7. But if they think they can
answer this reasoning thus,&amp;#8212;that the Father indeed is so called
in relation to the Son, and the Son in relation to the Father, but
that they are said to be unbegotten and begotten in relation to
themselves, not in relation each to the other; for that it is not
the same thing to call Him unbegotten as it is to call Him the
Father, because there would be nothing to hinder our calling Him
unbegotten even if He had not begotten the Son; and if any one
beget a son, he is not therefore himself unbegotten, for men, who
are begotten by other men, themselves also beget others; and
therefore they say the Father is called Father in relation to the
Son, and the Son is called Son in relation to the Father, but
unbegotten is said in relation to Himself, and begotten in relation
to Himself; and therefore, if whatever is said in relation to
oneself is said according to substance, while to be unbegotten
and to be begotten are different, then the substance is
different:&amp;#8212;if this is what they say, then they do not understand
that they do indeed say something that requires more careful
discussion in respect to the term unbegotten, because neither is
any one therefore a father because unbegotten, nor therefore
unbegotten because he is a father, and on that account he is
supposed to be called unbegotten, not in relation to anything else,
but in respect to himself; but, on the other hand, with a wonderful
blindness, they do not perceive that no one can be said to be
begotten except in relation to something. For he is therefore a son
because begotten; and because a son, therefore certainly begotten.
And as is the relation of son to father, so is the relation of the
begotten to the begetter; and as is the relation of father to son,
so is the relation of the begetter to the begotten. And therefore
any one is understood to be a begetter under one notion, but
understood to be unbegotten under another. For though both are said
of God the Father, yet the former is said in relation to the
begotten, that is to the Son, which, indeed, they do not deny; but
that He is called unbegotten, they declare to be said in respect to
Himself. They say then, If anything is said to be a father in
respect to itself, which cannot be said to be a son in respect to
itself, and whatever is said in respect to self is said according
to substance; and He is said to be unbegotten in respect to
Himself, which the Son cannot be said to be; therefore He is said
to be unbegotten according to substance; and because the Son cannot
be so said to be, therefore He is not of the same substance. This
subtlety is to be answered by compelling them to say themselves
according to what it is that the Son is equal to the Father;
whether according to that which is said in relation to Himself, or
according to that which is said in relation to the Father. For it
is not according to that which is said in relation to the Father,
since in relation to the Father He is said to be Son, and the
Father is not Son, but Father. Since Father and Son are not so
called in relation to each other in the same way as friends and
neighbors are; for a friend is so called relatively to his friend,
and if they love each other equally, then the same friendship is in
both; and a neighbor is so called relatively to a neighbor, and
because they are equally neighbors to each other (for each is
neighbor to the other, in the same degree as the other is neighbor
to him), there is the same neighborhood in both. But because the
Son is not so called relatively to the Son, but to the Father, it
is not according to that which is said in relation to the Father
that the Son is equal to the Father; and it remains that He is
equal according to that which is said in relation to Himself. But
whatever is said in relation to self is said according to
substance: it remains therefore that He is equal according to
substance; therefore the substance of both is the same. But when
the Father is said to be unbegotten, it is not said what He is, but
what He is not; and when a relative term is denied, it is not
denied according to substance, since the relative itself is not
affirmed according to substance.</text>

THE AGGRESSION 
OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA AGAINST 
THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

The Thirty-third Session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers (Session of Harmony of Rights, Freedoms, and Justice), held in Baku, Azerbaijan from 23-25 JAMADUL AWWAL 1427 A.H (19-21 June 2006)

Proceeding from the principles and objectives of the Charter of the Organization of the Islamic Conference; 

Gravely concerned over the aggression by the Republic of Armenia against the Republic of Azerbaijan which has resulted in the occupation of about 20 percent of the territories of Azerbaijan; 

Expressing its profound concern over continued occupation of significant part of the territories of Azerbaijan and illegal transfer of settlers of the Armenian nationality to those territories; 

Deeply distressed over the plight of more than one million Azerbaijani displaced persons and refugees resulting from the Armenian aggression and over magnitude and severity of these humanitarian problems; 

Reaffirming all previous relevant resolutions and, in particular, the Resolution No. 21/10-P(IS), adopted by the Tenth Session of the Islamic Summit Conference held in Putrajaya, from 20 to 21 Shaban, 1424H (16-17 October 2003); 

Urging strict adherence to the Charter of the UN and full implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions; 

Welcoming all diplomatic and other efforts for the settlement of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan; 

Reaffirming commitment by all Member States to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan; 

Noting also the destructive influence of the policy of aggression of the Republic of Armenia on the peace process within the OSCE framework; 

Taking note of the Report of the Secretary General (Document No. OIC/ICFM-33/POL/SG-REP.7). 

1. Strongly condemns the aggression of the Republic of Armenia against the Republic of Azerbaijan. 

2. Considers the actions perpetrated against civilian Azerbaijani population in the occupied Azerbaijani territories as crimes against humanity. 

3. Strongly condemns any looting and destruction of the archeological, cultural and religious monuments in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. 

4. Strongly demands the strict implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions 822, 853, 874 and 884, and the immediate, unconditional and complete withdrawal of Armenian forces from all occupied Azerbaijani territories including the Nagorno-Karabakh region and strongly urges Armenia to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 

5. Expresses its concern that Armenia has not yet implemented demands contained in the above stated UN Security Council resolutions. 

6. Calls on the UN Security Council to recognize the existence of aggression against the Republic of Azerbaijan; to take the necessary steps under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to ensure compliance with its resolutions; to condemn and reverse aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and decides to take coordinated action to this end at the United Nations. 

7. Urges all States to refrain from providing any supplies of arms and military equipment to Armenia, in order to deprive the aggressor of any opportunity to escalate the conflict and to continue the occupation of the Azerbaijani territories. The territories of the Member States should not be used for transit of such supplies. 

8. Calls upon Member States, as well as other members of the international community, to use such effective political and economic measures as required in order to put an end to Armenian aggression and occupation of the Azerbaijani territories. 

9. Calls for a just and peaceful settlement of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan on the basis of respect for the principles of territorial integrity of states and inviolability of internationally recognized borders. 

10. Decides to instruct the Permanent Representatives of Member States at the United Nations in New York, while voting at the UN General Assembly, to give full support to the issue of territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 

11. Urges Armenia and all Member States of the OSCE Minsk Group to engage constructively in the ongoing OSCE peace process on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and the relevant OSCE decisions and documents, including those of the First Additional Meeting of the OSCE Council of 24 March 1992, OSCE Summits of 5-6 December 1994, 2-3 December 1996, 18-19 November, 1999, and refrain from any action that will make it more difficult to reach a peaceful solution.

Expresses its full support for the three principles of the settlement of the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan contained in the statement of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office at the 1996 Lisbon OSCE Summit, namely the territorial integrity of the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan, highest degree of self-rule of the Nagorno-Karabakh region within Azerbaijan and guaranteed security for this region and its whole population. 

13. Stresses that fait accompli may not serve as a basis for a settlement, and that neither the current situation within the occupied areas of the Republic of Azerbaijan, nor any actions, including arranging voting process, undertaken there to consolidate the status quo, may be recognized as legally valid. 

14. Demands to cease and reverse immediately the transfer of settlers of the Armenian nationality to the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, which constitute a blatant violation of international humanitarian law and has a detrimental impact on the process of peaceful settlement of the conflict, and agrees to render its full support to the efforts of Azerbaijan undertaken to this end, including at the General Assembly of the United Nations, inter alia, through their respective Permanent Missions to the United Nations in New York. 

15. Expresses its support to the activities of the OSCE Minsk Group and consultations held at the level of the Foreign Ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia and its understanding that a step-by-step solution will help to ensure gradual elimination of the most serious consequences of the aggression against the Republic of Azerbaijan.

20. Expresses its concern over the severity of humanitarian problems concerning the existence of more than one million displaced persons and refugees in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan and requests the OIC Member States, the Islamic Development Bank and other Islamic Institutions to render much needed financial and humanitarian assistance to the Republic of Azerbaijan. 

21. Considers that Azerbaijan has the right for appropriate compensation with regard to damages it suffered as a result of the conflict and puts the responsibility for the adequate compensation of these damages on Armenia. 

22. Requests the Secretary-General to follow up the implementation of this resolution and to report thereon to the Thirty-fourth Session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers.</text>

18.  Those things, again, whether only sayings or whether actual deeds, which appear to the inexperienced to be sinful, and which are ascribed to God, or to men whose holiness is put before us as an example, are wholly figurative, and the hidden kernel of meaning they contain is to be picked out as food for the nourishment of charity.  Now, whoever uses transitory objects less freely than is the custom of those among whom he lives, is either temperate or superstitious; whoever, on the other hand, uses them so as to transgress the bounds of the custom of the good men about him, either has a further meaning in what he does, or is sinful.  In all such matters it is not the use of the objects, but the lust of the user, that is to blame.  Nobody in his sober senses would believe, for example, that when our Lord’s feet were anointed by the woman with precious ointment,&lt;ref&gt;John xii. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; it was for the same purpose for which luxurious and profligate men are accustomed to have theirs anointed in those banquets which we abhor.  For the sweet odor means the good report which is earned by a life of good works; and the man who wins this, while following in the footsteps of Christ, anoints His feet (so to speak) with the most precious ointment.  And so that which in the case of other persons is often a sin, becomes, when ascribed to God or a prophet, the sign of some great truth.  Keeping company with a harlot, for example, is one thing when it is the result of abandoned manners, another thing when done in the course of his prophecy by the prophet Hosea.&lt;ref&gt;Hos. i. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because it is a shamefully wicked thing to strip the body naked at a banquet among the drunken and licentious, it does not follow that it is a sin to be naked in the baths.

19.  We must, therefore, consider carefully what is suitable to times and places and persons, and not rashly charge men with sins.  For it is possible that a wise man may use the daintiest food without any sin of epicurism or gluttony, while a fool will crave for the vilest food with a most disgusting eagerness of appetite.  And any sane man would prefer eating fish after the manner of our Lord, to eating lentiles after the manner of Esau, or barley after the manner of oxen.  For there are several beasts that feed on commoner kinds of food, but it does not follow that they are more temperate than we are.  For in all matters of this kind it is not the nature of the things we use, but our reason for using them, and our manner of seeking them, that make what we do either praiseworthy or blameable.

20.  Now the saints of ancient times were, under the form of an earthly kingdom, foreshadowing and foretelling the kingdom of heaven.  And on account of the necessity for a numerous offspring, the custom of one man having several wives was at that time blameless:  and for the same reason it was not proper for one woman to have several husbands, because a woman does not in that way become more fruitful, but, on the contrary, it is base harlotry to seek either gain or offspring by promiscuous intercourse.  In regard to matters of this sort, whatever the holy men of those times did without lust, Scripture passes over without blame, although they did things which could not be done at the present time, except through lust.  And everything of this nature that is there narrated we are to take not only in its historical and literal, but also in its figurative and prophetical sense, and to interpret as bearing ultimately upon the end of love towards God or our neighbor, or both.  For as it was disgraceful among the ancient Romans to wear tunics reaching to the heels, and furnished with sleeves, but now it is disgraceful for men honorably born not to wear tunics of that description:  so we must take heed in regard to other things also, that lust do not mix with our use of them; for lust not only abuses to wicked ends the customs of those among whom we live, but frequently also transgressing the bounds of custom, betrays, in a disgraceful outbreak, its own hideousness, which was concealed under the cover of prevailing fashions.

Since October 13th, the day on which the demons had been expelled, life
at the convent seemed to have returned to its usual quiet; but Grandier
did not let himself be lulled to sleep by the calm: he knew those with
whom he was contending too well to imagine for an instant that he would
hear no more of them; and when the bailiff expressed pleasure at this
interval of repose, Grandier said that it would not last long, as the
nuns were only conning new parts, in order to carry on the drama in a
more effective manner than ever.  And in fact, on November 22nd, Rene
Mannouri, surgeon to the convent, was sent to one of his colleagues,
named Gaspard Joubert, to beg him to come, bringing some of the
physicians of the town with him, to visit the two sisters, who were again
tormented by evil spirits.  Mannouri, however, had gone to the wrong man,
for Joubert had a frank and loyal character, and hated everything that
was underhand.  Being determined to take no part in the business, except
in a public and judicial manner, he applied at once to the bailiff to
know if it was by his orders that he was called in.  The bailiff said it
was not, and summoned Mannouri before him to ask him by whose authority
he had sent for Joubert.  Mannouri declared that the 'touriere' had run
in a fright to his house, saying that the nuns had never been worse
possessed than now, and that the director, Mignon, begged him to come at
once to the convent, bringing with him all the doctors he could find.

The bailiff, seeing that fresh plots against Grandier were being formed,
sent for him and warned him that Barre had come over from Chinon the day
before, and had resumed his exorcisms at the convent, adding that it was
currently reported in the town that the mother superior and Sister Claire
were again tormented by devils.  The news neither astonished nor
discouraged Grandier, who replied, with his usual smile of disdain, that
it was evident his enemies were hatching new plots against him, and that
as he had instituted proceedings against them for the former ones, he
would take the same course with regard to these.  At the same time,
knowing how impartial the bailiff was, he begged him to accompany the
doctors and officials to the convent, and to be present at the exorcisms,
and should any sign of real possession manifest itself, to sequester the
afflicted nuns at once, and cause them to be examined by other persons
than Mignon and Barre, whom he had such good cause to distrust.

The bailiff wrote to the king's attorney, who, notwithstanding his bias
against Grandier, was forced to see that the conclusions arrived at were
correct, and having certified this in writing, he at once sent his clerk
to the convent to inquire if the superior were still possessed.  In case
of an affirmative reply being given, the clerk had instructions to warn
Mignon and Barre that they were not to undertake exorcisms unless in
presence of the bailiff and of such officials and doctors as he might
choose to bring with him, and that they would disobey at their peril; he
was also to tell them that Grandier's demands to have the nuns
sequestered and other exorcists called in were granted.

Mignon and Barre listened while the clerk read his instructions, and then
said they refused to recognise the jurisdiction of the bailiff in this
case; that they had been summoned by the mother superior and Sister
Claire when their strange illness returned, an illness which they were
convinced was nothing else than possession by evil spirits; that they had
hitherto carried out their exorcisms under the authority of a commission
given them by the Bishop of Poitiers; and as the time for which they had
permission had not yet expired; they would continue to exorcise as often
as might be necessary.  They had, however, given notice to the worthy
prelate of what was going on, in order that he might either come himself
or send other exorcists as best suited him, so that a valid opinion as to
the reality, of the possession might be procured, for up to the present
the worldly and unbelieving had taken upon themselves to declare in an
off-hand manner that the whole affair was a mixture of fraud and
delusion, in contempt of the glory of God and the Catholic religion.  As
to the rest of the message, they would not, in any way prevent the
bailiff and the other officials, with as many medical men as they chose
to bring, from seeing the nuns, at least until they heard from the
bishop, from whom they expected a letter next day.  But it was for the
nuns themselves to say whether it was convenient for them to receive
visitors; as far as concerned themselves, they desired to renew their
protest, and declared they could not accept the bailiff as their judge,
and did not think that it could be legal for them to refuse to obey a
command from their ecclesiastical superiors, whether with relation to
exorcism or any other thing of which the ecclesiastical courts properly
took cognisance.  The clerk brought this answer to the bailiff, and he,
thinking it was better to wait for the arrival of the bishop or of fresh
orders from him, put off his visit to the convent until the next day.
But the next day came without anything being heard of the prelate himself
or of a messenger from him.

Early in the morning the bailiff went to the convent, but was not
admitted; he then waited patiently until noon, and seeing that no news
had arrived from Dissay, and that the convent gates were still closed
against him, he granted a second petition of Grandier's, to the effect
that Byre and Mignon should be prohibited from questioning the superior
and the other nuns in a manner tending to blacken the character of the
petitioner or any other person.  Notice of this prohibition was served
the same day on Barre and on one nun chosen to represent the community.
Barre did not pay the slightest attention to this notice, but kept on
asserting that the bailiff had no right to prevent his obeying the
commands of his bishop, and declaring that henceforward he would perform
all exorcisms solely under ecclesiastical sanction, without any reference
to lay persons, whose unbelief and impatience impaired the solemnity with
which such rites should be conducted.

The best part of the day having gone over without any sign of either
bishop or messenger, Grandier presented a new petition to the bailiff.
The bailiff at once summoned all the officers of the bailiwick and the
attorneys of the king, in order to lay it before them; but the king's
attorneys refused to consider the matter, declaring upon their honour
that although they did not accuse Grandier of being the cause, yet they
believed that the nuns were veritably possessed, being convinced by the
testimony of the devout ecclesiastics in whose presence the evil spirits
had come out.  This was only the ostensible reason for their refusal, the
real one being that the advocate was a relation of Mignon's, and the
attorney a son-in-law of Trinquant's, to whose office he had succeeded.
Thus Grandier, against whom were all the ecclesiastical judges, began to
feel as if he were condemned beforehand by the judges of the royal
courts, for he knew how very short was the interval between the
recognition of the possession as a fact and the recognition of himself as
its author.

Nevertheless, in spite of the formal declarations of the king's advocate
and attorney, the bailiff ordered the superior and the lay sister to be
removed to houses in town, each to be accompanied by a nun as companion.
During their absence from the convent they were to be looked after by
exorcists, by women of high character and position, as well as by
physicians and attendants, all of whom he himself would appoint, all
others being forbidden access to the nuns without his permission.

The clerk was again sent to the convent with a copy of this decision, but
the superior having listened to the reading of the document, answered
that in her own name and that of the sisterhood she refused to recognise
the jurisdiction of the bailiff; that she had already received directions
from the Bishop of Poitiers, dated 18th November, explaining the measures
which were to be taken in the matter, and she would gladly send a copy of
these directions to the bailiff, to prevent his pleading ignorance of
them; furthermore, she demurred to the order for her removal, having
vowed to live always secluded in a convent, and that no one could
dispense her from this vow but the bishop.  This protest having been made
in the presence of Madame de Charnisay, aunt of two of the nuns, and
Surgeon Mannouri, who was related to another, they both united in drawing
up a protest against violence, in case the bailiff should insist on
having his orders carried out, declaring that, should he make the
attempt, they would resist him, as if he were a mere private individual.
This document being duly signed and witnessed was immediately sent to the
bailiff by the hand of his own clerk, whereupon the bailiff ordered that
preparations should be made with regard to the sequestration, and
announced that the next day, the 24th November, he would repair to the
convent and be present at the exorcisms.

The next day accordingly, at the appointed hour, the bailiff summoned
Daniel Roger, Vincent de Faux, Gaspard Joubert, and Matthieu Fanson, all
four physicians, to his presence, and acquainting them with his reasons
for having called them, asked them to accompany him to the convent to
examine, with the most scrupulous impartiality, two nuns whom he would
point out, in order to discover if their illness were feigned, or arose
from natural or supernatural causes.  Having thus instructed them as to
his wishes, they all set out for the convent.

They were shown into the chapel and placed close to the altar, being
separated by a grating from the choir, in which the nuns who sang usually
sat.  In a few moments the superior was carried in on a small bed, which
was laid down before the grating.  Barre then said mass, during which the
superior went into violent convulsions.  She threw her arms about, her
fingers were clenched, her cheeks enormously inflated, and her eyes
turned up so that only the whites could be seen.

The mass finished, Barre approached her to administer the holy communion
and to commence the exorcism.  Holding the holy wafer in his hand, he
said--

&quot;Adora Deum tuum, creatorem tuum&quot; (Adore God, thy Creator).

The superior hesitated, as if she found great difficulty in making this
act of love, but at length she said--

&quot;Adoro te&quot; (I adore Thee).

&quot;Quem adoras?&quot; (Whom dost thou adore?)

&quot;Jesus Christus&quot; (Jesus Christ), answered the nun, quite unconscious that
the verb adorn governs accusative.

This mistake, which no sixth-form boy would make, gave rise to bursts of
laughter in the church; and Daniel Douin, the provost's assessor, was
constrained to say aloud--

&quot;There's a devil for you, who does not know much about transitive verbs.&quot;

Barre perceiving the bad impression that the superior's nominative had
made, hastened to ask her--

&quot;Quis est iste quem adoras?&quot; (Who is it whom thou dost adore?)

His hope was that she would again reply &quot;Jesus Christus,&quot; but he was
disappointed.

&quot;Jesu Christe,&quot; was her answer.

Renewed shouts of laughter greeted this infraction of one of the most
elementary rules of syntax, and several of those present exclaimed:

&quot;Oh, your reverence, what very poor Latin!&quot;

Barre pretended not to hear, and next asked what was the name of the
demon who had taken possession of her.  The poor superior, who was
greatly confused by the unexpected effect of her last two answers, could
not speak for a long time; but at length with great trouble she brought
out the name Asmodee, without daring to latinise it.  The exorcist then
inquired how many devils the superior had in her body, and to this
question she replied quite fluently:

&quot;Sex&quot; (Six).

The bailiff upon this requested Barre to ask the chief devil how many
evil spirits he had with him.  But the need for this answer had been
foreseen, and the nun unhesitatingly returned--

&quot;Quinque&quot; (Five).

This answer raised Asmodee somewhat in the opinion of those present; but
when the bailiff adjured the superior to repeat in Greek what she had
just said in Latin she made no reply, and on the adjuration being renewed
she immediately recovered her senses.

The examination of the superior being thus cut short, a little nun who
appeared for the first time in public was brought forward.  She began by
twice pronouncing the name of Grandier with a loud laugh; then turning to
the bystanders, called out--

&quot;For all your number, you can do nothing worth while.&quot;

As it was easy to see that nothing of importance was to be expected from
this new patient, she was soon suppressed, and her place taken by the lay
sister Claire who had already made her debut in the mother superior's
room.

Hardly had she entered the choir than she uttered a groan, but as soon as
they placed her on the little bed on which the other nuns had lain, she
gave way to uncontrollable laughter, and cried out between the
paroxysms--

&quot;Grandier, Grandier, you must buy some at the market.&quot;

Barre at once declared that these wild and whirling words were a proof of
possession, and approached to exorcise the demon; but Sister Claire
resisted, and pretending to spit in the face of the exorcist, put out her
tongue at him, making indecent gestures, using a word in harmony with her
actions.  This word being in the vernacular was understood by everyone
and required no interpretation.

The exorcist then conjured her to give the name of the demon who was in
her, and she replied--

&quot;Grandier.&quot;

But Barre by repeating his question gave her to understand that she had
made a mistake, whereupon she corrected herself and said--

&quot;Elimi.&quot;

Nothing in the world could induce her to reveal the number of evil
spirits by whom Elimi was accompanied, so that Barre, seeing that it was
useless to press her on this point, passed on to the next question.

&quot;Quo pacto ingressus est daemon&quot;(By what pact did the demon get in?).

&quot;Duplex&quot; (Double), returned Sister Claire.

This horror of the ablative, when the ablative was absolutely necessary,
aroused once more the hilarity of the audience, and proved that Sister
Claire's devil was just as poor a Latin scholar as the superior's, and
Barre, fearing some new linguistic eccentricity on the part of the evil
spirit, adjourned the meeting to another day.

The paucity of learning shown in the answers of the nuns being sufficient
to convince any fairminded person that the whole affair was a ridiculous
comedy, the bailiff felt encouraged to persevere until he had unravelled
the whole plot.  Consequently, at three o'clock in the afternoon, he
returned to the convent, accompanied by his clerk, by several
magistrates, and by a considerable number of the best known people of
Loudun, and asked to see the superior. Being admitted, he announced to
Barre that he had come to insist on the superior being separated from
Sister Claire, so that each could be exorcised apart.  Barre dared not
refuse before such a great number of witnesses, therefore the superior
was isolated and the exorcisms begun all over again.  Instantly the
convulsions returned, just as in the morning, only that now she twisted
her feet into the form of hooks, which was a new accomplishment.

Having adjured her several times, the exorcist succeeded in making her
repeat some prayers, and then sounded her as to the name and number of
the demons in possession, whereupon she said three times that there was
one called Achaos.  The bailiff then directed Barre to ask if she were
possessed 'ex pacto magi, aut ex Aura voluntate Dei' (by a pact with a
sorcerer or by the pure will of God), to which the superior answered

&quot;Non est voluutas Dei&quot; (Not by the will of God).

Upon this, Barre dreading more questions from the bystanders, hastily
resumed his own catechism by asking who was the sorcerer.

&quot;Urbanus,&quot; answered the superior.

&quot;Est-ne Urbanus papa&quot; (Is it Pope Urban?), asked the exorcist.

&quot;Grandier,&quot; replied the superior.

&quot;Quare ingressus es in corpus hujus puellae&quot; (Why did you enter the body
of this maiden?), said Barre.

&quot;Propter praesentiam tuum&quot; (Because of your presence), answered the
superior.

At this point the bailiff, seeing no reason why the dialogue between
Barre and the superior should ever come to an end, interposed and
demanded that questions suggested by him and the other officials present
should be put to the superior, promising that if she answered three of
four such questions correctly, he, and those with him, would believe in
the reality of the possession, and would certify to that effect.  Barre
accepted the challenge, but unluckily just at that moment the superior
regained consciousness, and as it was already late, everyone retired.</text>

IN THE MOUNTAIN, APIA, SAMOA,
MONDAY, NOVEMBER 2ND, 1890


MY DEAR COLVIN, - This is a hard and interesting and 
beautiful life that we lead now.  Our place is in a deep 
cleft of Vaea Mountain, some six hundred feet above the sea, 
embowered in forest, which is our strangling enemy, and which 
we combat with axes and dollars.  I went crazy over outdoor 
work, and had at last to confine myself to the house, or 
literature must have gone by the board.  NOTHING is so 
interesting as weeding, clearing, and path-making; the 
oversight of labourers becomes a disease; it is quite an 
effort not to drop into the farmer; and it does make you feel 
so well.  To come down covered with mud and drenched with 
sweat and rain after some hours in the bush, change, rub 
down, and take a chair in the verandah, is to taste a quiet 
conscience.  And the strange thing that I mark is this: If I 
go out and make sixpence, bossing my labourers and plying the 
cutlass or the spade, idiot conscience applauds me; if I sit 
in the house and make twenty pounds, idiot conscience wails 
over my neglect and the day wasted.  For near a fortnight I 
did not go beyond the verandah; then I found my rush of work 
run out, and went down for the night to Apia; put in Sunday 
afternoon with our consul, 'a nice young man,' dined with my 
friend H. J. Moors in the evening, went to church - no less - 
at the white and half-white church - I had never been before, 
and was much interested; the woman I sat next LOOKED a full-
blood native, and it was in the prettiest and readiest 
English that she sang the hymns; back to Moors', where we 
yarned of the islands, being both wide wanderers, till bed-
time; bed, sleep, breakfast, horse saddled; round to the 
mission, to get Mr. Clarke to be my interpreter; over with 
him to the King's, whom I have not called on since my return; 
received by that mild old gentleman; have some interesting 
talk with him about Samoan superstitions and my land - the 
scene of a great battle in his (Malietoa Laupepa's) youth - 
the place which we have cleared the platform of his fort - 
the gulley of the stream full of dead bodies - the fight 
rolled off up Vaea mountain-side; back with Clarke to the 
Mission; had a bit of lunch and consulted over a queer point 
of missionary policy just arisen, about our new Town Hall and 
the balls there - too long to go into, but a quaint example 
of the intricate questions which spring up daily in the 
missionary path.

Then off up the hill; Jack very fresh, the sun (close on 
noon) staring hot, the breeze very strong and pleasant; the 
ineffable green country all round - gorgeous little birds (I 
think they are humming birds, but they say not) skirmishing 
in the wayside flowers.  About a quarter way up I met a 
native coming down with the trunk of a cocoa palm across his 
shoulder; his brown breast glittering with sweat and oil: 
'Talofa' - 'Talofa, alii - You see that white man?  He speak 
for you.'  'White man he gone up here?' - 'Ioe (Yes)' - 
'Tofa, alii' - 'Tofa, soifua!'  I put on Jack up the steep 
path, till he is all as white as shaving stick - Brown's 
euxesis, wish I had some - past Tanugamanono, a bush village 
- see into the houses as I pass - they are open sheds 
scattered on a green - see the brown folk sitting there, 
suckling kids, sleeping on their stiff wooden pillows - then 
on through the wood path - and here I find the mysterious 
white man (poor devil!) with his twenty years' certificate of 
good behaviour as a book-keeper, frozen out by the strikes in 
the colonies, come up here on a chance, no work to be found, 
big hotel bill, no ship to leave in - and come up to beg 
twenty dollars because he heard I was a Scotchman, offering 
to leave his portmanteau in pledge.  Settle this, and on 
again; and here my house comes in view, and a war whoop 
fetches my wife and Henry (or Simele), our Samoan boy, on the 
front balcony; and I am home again, and only sorry that I 
shall have to go down again to Apia this day week.  I could, 
and would, dwell here unmoved, but there are things to be 
attended to.

Never say I don't give you details and news.  That is a 
picture of a letter.

I have been hard at work since I came; three chapters of THE 
WRECKER, and since that, eight of the South Sea book, and, 
along and about and in between, a hatful of verses.  Some day 
I'll send the verse to you, and you'll say if any of it is 
any good.  I have got in a better vein with the South Sea 
book, as I think you will see; I think these chapters will do 
for the volume without much change.  Those that I did in the 
JANET NICOLL, under the most ungodly circumstances, I fear 
will want a lot of suppling and lightening, but I hope to 
have your remarks in a month or two upon that point.  It 
seems a long while since I have heard from you.  I do hope 
you are well.  I am wonderful, but tired from so much work; 
'tis really immense what I have done; in the South Sea book I 
have fifty pages copied fair, some of which has been four 
times, and all twice written, certainly fifty pages of solid 
scriving inside a fortnight, but I was at it by seven a.m. 
till lunch, and from two till four or five every day; between 
whiles, verse and blowing on the flageolet; never outside.  
If you could see this place! but I don't want any one to see 
it till my clearing is done, and my house built.  It will be 
a home for angels.

So far I wrote after my bit of dinner, some cold meat and 
bananas, on arrival.  Then out to see where Henry and some of 
the men were clearing the garden; for it was plain there was 
to be no work to-day indoors, and I must set in consequence 
to farmering.  I stuck a good while on the way up, for the 
path there is largely my own handiwork, and there were a lot 
of sprouts and saplings and stones to be removed.  Then I 
reached our clearing just where the streams join in one; it 
had a fine autumn smell of burning, the smoke blew in the 
woods, and the boys were pretty merry and busy.  Now I had a 
private design:-

[Map which cannot be reproduced]

The Vaita'e I had explored pretty far up; not yet the other 
stream, the Vaituliga (g=nasal n, as ng in sing); and up 
that, with my wood knife, I set off alone.  It is here quite 
dry; it went through endless woods; about as broad as a 
Devonshire lane, here and there crossed by fallen trees; huge 
trees overhead in the sun, dripping lianas and tufted with 
orchids, tree ferns, ferns depending with air roots from the 
steep banks, great arums - I had not skill enough to say if 
any of them were the edible kind, one of our staples here! - 
hundreds of bananas - another staple - and alas!  I had skill 
enough to know all of these for the bad kind that bears no 
fruit.  My Henry moralised over this the other day; how hard 
it was that the bad banana flourished wild, and the good must 
be weeded and tended; and I had not the heart to tell him how 
fortunate they were here, and how hungry were other lands by 
comparison.  The ascent of this lovely lane of my dry stream 
filled me with delight.  I could not but be reminded of old 
Mayne Reid, as I have been more than once since I came to the 
tropics; and I thought, if Reid had been still living, I 
would have written to tell him that, for, me, IT HAD COME 
TRUE; and I thought, forbye, that, if the great powers go on 
as they are going, and the Chief Justice delays, it would 
come truer still; and the war-conch will sound in the hills, 
and my home will be inclosed in camps, before the year is 
ended.  And all at once - mark you, how Mayne Reid is on the 
spot - a strange thing happened.  I saw a liana stretch 
across the bed of the brook about breast-high, swung up my 
knife to sever it, and - behold, it was a wire!  On either 
hand it plunged into thick bush; to-morrow I shall see where 
it goes and get a guess perhaps of what it means.  To-day I 
know no more than - there it is.  A little higher the brook 
began to trickle, then to fill.  At last, as I meant to do 
some work upon the homeward trail, it was time to turn.  I 
did not return by the stream; knife in hand, as long as my 
endurance lasted, I was to cut a path in the congested bush.

At first it went ill with me; I got badly stung as high as 
the elbows by the stinging plant; I was nearly hung in a 
tough liana - a rotten trunk giving way under my feet; it was 
deplorable bad business.  And an axe - if I dared swing one - 
would have been more to the purpose than my cutlass.  Of a 
sudden things began to go strangely easier; I found stumps, 
bushing out again; my body began to wonder, then my mind; I 
raised my eyes and looked ahead; and, by George, I was no 
longer pioneering, I had struck an old track overgrown, and 
was restoring an old path.  So I laboured till I was in such 
a state that Carolina Wilhelmina Skeggs could scarce have 
found a name for it.  Thereon desisted; returned to the 
stream; made my way down that stony track to the garden, 
where the smoke was still hanging and the sun was still in 
the high tree-tops, and so home.  Here, fondly supposing my 
long day was over, I rubbed down; exquisite agony; water 
spreads the poison of these weeds; I got it all over my 
hands, on my chest, in my eyes, and presently, while eating 
an orange, A LA Raratonga, burned my lip and eye with orange 
juice.  Now, all day, our three small pigs had been adrift, 
to the mortal peril of our corn, lettuce, onions, etc., and 
as I stood smarting on the back verandah, behold the three 
piglings issuing from the wood just opposite.  Instantly I 
got together as many boys as I could - three, and got the 
pigs penned against the rampart of the sty, till the others 
joined; whereupon we formed a cordon, closed, captured the 
deserters, and dropped them, squeaking amain, into their 
strengthened barracks where, please God, they may now stay!

Perhaps you may suppose the day now over; you are not the 
head of a plantation, my juvenile friend.  Politics 
succeeded: Henry got adrift in his English, Bene was too 
cowardly to tell me what he was after: result, I have lost 
seven good labourers, and had to sit down and write to you to 
keep my temper.  Let me sketch my lads. - Henry - Henry has 
gone down to town or I could not be writing to you - this 
were the hour of his English lesson else, when he learns what 
he calls 'long expessions' or 'your chief's language' for the 
matter of an hour and a half - Henry is a chiefling from 
Savaii; I once loathed, I now like and - pending fresh 
discoveries - have a kind of respect for Henry.  He does good 
work for us; goes among the labourers, bossing and watching; 
helps Fanny; is civil, kindly, thoughtful; O SI SIC SEMPER!  
But will he be 'his sometime self throughout the year'?  
Anyway, he has deserved of us, and he must disappoint me 
sharply ere I give him up. - Bene - or Peni-Ben, in plain 
English - is supposed to be my ganger; the Lord love him!  
God made a truckling coward, there is his full history.  He 
cannot tell me what he wants; he dares not tell me what is 
wrong; he dares not transmit my orders or translate my 
censures.  And with all this, honest, sober, industrious, 
miserably smiling over the miserable issue of his own 
unmanliness. - Paul - a German - cook and steward - a glutton 
of work - a splendid fellow; drawbacks, three: (1) no cook; 
(2) an inveterate bungler; a man with twenty thumbs, 
continually falling in the dishes, throwing out the dinner, 
preserving the garbage; (3) a dr-, well, don't let us say 
that - but we daren't let him go to town, and he - poor, good 
soul - is afraid to be let go. - Lafaele (Raphael), a strong, 
dull, deprecatory man; splendid with an axe, if watched; the 
better for a rowing, when he calls me 'Papa' in the most 
wheedling tones; desperately afraid of ghosts, so that he 
dare not walk alone up in the banana patch - see map.  The 
rest are changing labourers; and to-night, owing to the 
miserable cowardice of Peni, who did not venture to tell me 
what the men wanted - and which was no more than fair - all 
are gone - and my weeding in the article of being finished!  
Pity the sorrows of a planter.

I am, Sir, yours, and be jowned to you, The Planter,
R. L. S.


Tuesday 3rd


I begin to see the whole scheme of letter-writing; you sit 
down every day and pour out an equable stream of twaddle.

This morning all my fears were fled, and all the trouble had 
fallen to the lot of Peni himself, who deserved it; my field 
was full of weeders; and I am again able to justify the ways 
of God.  All morning I worked at the South Seas, and finished 
the chapter I had stuck upon on Saturday.  Fanny, awfully 
hove-to with rheumatics and injuries received upon the field 
of sport and glory, chasing pigs, was unable to go up and 
down stairs, so she sat upon the back verandah, and my work 
was chequered by her cries.  'Paul, you take a spade to do 
that - dig a hole first.  If you do that, you'll cut your 
foot off!  Here, you boy, what you do there?  You no get 
work?  You go find Simele; he give you work.  Peni, you tell 
this boy he go find Simele; suppose Simele no give him work, 
you tell him go 'way.  I no want him here.  That boy no 
good.' - PENI (from the distance in reassuring tones), 'All 
right, sir!' - FANNY (after a long pause), 'Peni, you tell 
that boy go find Simele!  I no want him stand here all day.  
I no pay that boy.  I see him all day.  He no do nothing.' - 
Luncheon, beef, soda-scones, fried bananas, pine-apple in 
claret, coffee.  Try to write a poem; no go.  Play the 
flageolet.  Then sneakingly off to farmering and pioneering.  
Four gangs at work on our place; a lively scene; axes 
crashing and smoke blowing; all the knives are out.  But I 
rob the garden party of one without a stock, and you should 
see my hand - cut to ribbons.  Now I want to do my path up 
the Vaituliga single-handed, and I want it to burst on the 
public complete.  Hence, with devilish ingenuity, I begin it 
at different places; so that if you stumble on one section, 
you may not even then suspect the fulness of my labours.  
Accordingly, I started in a new place, below the wire, and 
hoping to work up to it.  It was perhaps lucky I had so bad a 
cutlass, and my smarting hand bid me stay before I had got up 
to the wire, but just in season, so that I was only the 
better of my activity, not dead beat as yesterday.

A strange business it was, and infinitely solitary; away 
above, the sun was in the high tree-tops; the lianas noosed 
and sought to hang me; the saplings struggled, and came up 
with that sob of death that one gets to know so well; great, 
soft, sappy trees fell at a lick of the cutlass, little tough 
switches laughed at and dared my best endeavour.  Soon, 
toiling down in that pit of verdure, I heard blows on the far 
side, and then laughter.  I confess a chill settled on my 
heart.

Being so dead alone, in a place where by rights none should 
be beyond me, I was aware, upon interrogation, if those blows 
had drawn nearer, I should (of course quite unaffectedly) 
have executed a strategic movement to the rear; and only the 
other day I was lamenting my insensibility to superstition!  
Am I beginning to be sucked in?  Shall I become a midnight 
twitterer like my neighbours?  At times I thought the blows 
were echoes; at times I thought the laughter was from birds.  
For our birds are strangely human in their calls.  Vaea 
mountain about sundown sometimes rings with shrill cries, 
like the hails of merry, scattered children.  As a matter of 
fact, I believe stealthy wood-cutters from Tanugamanono were 
above me in the wood and answerable for the blows; as for the 
laughter, a woman and two children had come and asked Fanny's 
leave to go up shrimp-fishing in the burn; beyond doubt, it 
was these I heard.  Just at the right time I returned; to 
wash down, change, and begin this snatch of letter before 
dinner was ready, and to finish it afterwards, before Henry 
has yet put in an appearance for his lesson in 'long 
explessions.'

Dinner: stewed beef and potatoes, baked bananas, new loaf-
bread hot from the oven, pine-apple in claret.  These are 
great days; we have been low in the past; but now are we as 
belly-gods, enjoying all things.


WEDNESDAY.  (HIST. VAILIMA RESUMED.)


A gorgeous evening of after-glow in the great tree-tops and 
behind the mountain, and full moon over the lowlands and the 
sea, inaugurated a night of horrid cold.  To you effete 
denizens of the so-called temperate zone, it had seemed 
nothing; neither of us could sleep; we were up seeking extra 
coverings, I know not at what hour - it was as bright as day.  
The moon right over Vaea - near due west, the birds strangely 
silent, and the wood of the house tingling with cold; I 
believe it must have been 60 degrees!  Consequence; Fanny has 
a headache and is wretched, and I could do no work.  (I am 
trying all round for a place to hold my pen; you will hear 
why later on; this to explain penmanship.)  I wrote two 
pages, very bad, no movement, no life or interest; then I 
wrote a business letter; then took to tootling on the 
flageolet, till glory should call me farmering.

I took up at the fit time Lafaele and Mauga - Mauga, accent 
on the first, is a mountain, I don't know what Mauga means - 
mind what I told you of the value of g - to the garden, and 
set them digging, then turned my attention to the path.  I 
could not go into my bush path for two reasons: 1st, sore 
hands; 2nd, had on my trousers and good shoes.  Lucky it was.  
Right in the wild lime hedge which cuts athwart us just 
homeward of the garden, I found a great bed of kuikui - 
sensitive plant - our deadliest enemy.  A fool brought it to 
this island in a pot, and used to lecture and sentimentalise 
over the tender thing.  The tender thing has now taken charge 
of this island, and men fight it, with torn hands, for bread 
and life.  A singular, insidious thing, shrinking and biting 
like a weasel; clutching by its roots as a limpet clutches to 
a rock.  As I fought him, I bettered some verses in my poem, 
the WOODMAN; the only thought I gave to letters.  Though the 
kuikui was thick, there was but a small patch of it, and when 
I was done I attacked the wild lime, and had a hand-to-hand 
skirmish with its spines and elastic suckers.  All this time, 
close by, in the cleared space of the garden, Lafaele and 
Mauga were digging.  Suddenly quoth Lafaele, 'Somebody he 
sing out.' - 'Somebody he sing out?  All right.  I go.'  And 
I went and found they had been whistling and 'singing out' 
for long, but the fold of the hill and the uncleared bush 
shuts in the garden so that no one heard, and I was late for 
dinner, and Fanny's headache was cross; and when the meal was 
over, we had to cut up a pineapple which was going bad, to 
make jelly of; and the next time you have a handful of broken 
blood-blisters, apply pine-apple juice, and you will give me 
news of it, and I request a specimen of your hand of write 
five minutes after - the historic moment when I tackled this 
history.  My day so far.

Fanny was to have rested.  Blessed Paul began making a duck-
house; she let him be; the duck-house fell down, and she had 
to set her hand to it.  He was then to make a drinking-place 
for the pigs; she let him be again - he made a stair by which 
the pigs will probably escape this evening, and she was near 
weeping.  Impossible to blame the indefatigable fellow; 
energy is too rare and goodwill too noble a thing to 
discourage; but it's trying when she wants a rest.  Then she 
had to cook the dinner; then, of course - like a fool and a 
woman - must wait dinner for me, and make a flurry of 
herself.  Her day so far.  CETERA ADHUC DESUNT.


FRIDAY - I THINK.


I have been too tired to add to this chronicle, which will at 
any rate give you some guess of our employment.  All goes 
well; the kuikui - (think of this mispronunciation having 
actually infected me to the extent of misspelling! tuitui is 
the word by rights) - the tuitui is all out of the paddock - 
a fenced park between the house and boundary; Peni's men 
start to-day on the road; the garden is part burned, part 
dug; and Henry, at the head of a troop of underpaid 
assistants, is hard at work clearing.  The part clearing you 
will see from the map; from the house run down to the stream 
side, up the stream nearly as high as the garden; then back 
to the star which I have just added to the map.

My long, silent contests in the forest have had a strange 
effect on me.  The unconcealed vitality of these vegetables, 
their exuberant number and strength, the attempts - I can use 
no other word - of lianas to enwrap and capture the intruder, 
the awful silence, the knowledge that all my efforts are only 
like the performance of an actor, the thing of a moment, and 
the wood will silently and swiftly heal them up with fresh 
effervescence; the cunning sense of the tuitui, suffering 
itself to be touched with wind-swayed grasses and not minding 
- but let the grass be moved by a man, and it shuts up; the 
whole silent battle, murder, and slow death of the contending 
forest; weigh upon the imagination.  My poem the WOODMAN 
stands; but I have taken refuge in a new story, which just 
shot through me like a bullet in one of my moments of awe, 
alone in that tragic jungle:-


THE HIGH WOODS OF ULUFANUA.

1. A South Sea Bridal.
2. Under the Ban.
3. Savao and Faavao.
4. Cries in the High Wood.
5. Rumour full of Tongues.
6. The Hour of Peril.
7. The Day of Vengeance.


It is very strange, very extravagant, I daresay; but it's 
varied, and picturesque, and has a pretty love affair, and 
ends well.  Ulufanua is a lovely Samoan word, ulu=grove; 
fanua=land; grove-land - 'the tops of the high trees.'  
Savao, 'sacred to the wood,' and Faavao, 'wood-ways,' are the 
names of two of the characters, Ulufanua the name of the 
supposed island.

I am very tired, and rest off to-day from all but letters.  
Fanny is quite done up; she could not sleep last night, 
something it seemed like asthma - I trust not.  I suppose 
Lloyd will be about, so you can give him the benefit of this 
long scrawl.  Never say that I CAN'T write a letter, say that 
I don't. - Yours ever, my dearest fellow,
R. L. S.


LATER ON FRIDAY.


The guid wife had bread to bake, and she baked it in a pan, 
O!  But between whiles she was down with me weeding sensitive 
in the paddock.  The men have but now passed over it; I was 
round in that very place to see the weeding was done 
thoroughly, and already the reptile springs behind our heels.  
Tuitui is a truly strange beast, and gives food for thought.  
I am nearly sure - I cannot yet be quite, I mean to 
experiment, when I am less on the hot chase of the beast - 
that, even at the instant he shrivels up his leaves, he 
strikes his prickles downward so as to catch the uprooting 
finger; instinctive, say the gabies; but so is man's impulse 
to strike out.  One thing that takes and holds me is to see 
the strange variation in the propagation of alarm among these 
rooted beasts; at times it spreads to a radius (I speak by 
the guess of the eye) of five or six inches; at times only 
one individual plant appears frightened at a time.  We tried 
how long it took one to recover; 'tis a sanguine creature; it 
is all abroad again before (I guess again) two minutes.  It 
is odd how difficult in this world it is to be armed.  The 
double armour of this plant betrays it.  In a thick tuft, 
where the leaves disappear, I thrust in my hand, and the bite 
of the thorns betrays the topmost stem.  In the open again, 
and when I hesitate if it be clover, a touch on the leaves, 
and its fine sense and retractile action betrays its identity 
at once.  Yet it has one gift incomparable.  Rome had virtue 
and knowledge; Rome perished.  The sensitive plant has 
indigestible seeds - so they say - and it will flourish for 
ever.  I give my advice thus to a young plant - have a strong 
root, a weak stem, and an indigestible seed; so you will 
outlast the eternal city, and your progeny will clothe 
mountains, and the irascible planter will blaspheme in vain.  
The weak point of tuitui is that its stem is strong.


SUPPLEMENTARY PAGE.


Here beginneth the third lesson, which is not from the 
planter but from a less estimable character, the writer of 
books.

I want you to understand about this South Sea Book.  The job 
is immense; I stagger under material.  I have seen the first 
big TACHE.  It was necessary to see the smaller ones; the 
letters were at my hand for the purpose, but I was not going 
to lose this experience; and, instead of writing mere 
letters, have poured out a lot of stuff for the book.  How 
this works and fits, time is to show.  But I believe, in 
time, I shall get the whole thing in form.  Now, up to date, 
that is all my design, and I beg to warn you till we have the 
whole (or much) of the stuff together, you can hardly judge - 
and I can hardly judge.  Such a mass of stuff is to be 
handled, if possible without repetition - so much foreign 
matter to be introduced - if possible with perspicuity - and, 
as much as can be, a spirit of narrative to be preserved.  
You will find that come stronger as I proceed, and get the 
explanations worked through.  Problems of style are (as yet) 
dirt under my feet; my problem is architectural, creative - 
to get this stuff jointed and moving.  If I can do that, I 
will trouble you for style; anybody might write it, and it 
would be splendid; well-engineered, the masses right, the 
blooming thing travelling - twig?

This I wanted you to understand, for lots of the stuff sent 
home is, I imagine, rot - and slovenly rot - and some of it 
pompous rot; and I want you to understand it's a LAY-IN.

Soon, if the tide of poeshie continues, I'll send you a whole 
lot to damn.  You never said thank-you for the handsome 
tribute addressed to you from Apemama; such is the gratitude 
of the world to the God-sent poick.  Well, well:- 'Vex not 
thou the poick's mind, With thy coriaceous ingratitude, The 
P. will be to your faults more than a little blind, And yours 
is a far from handsome attitude.'  Having thus dropped into 
poetry in a spirit of friendship, I have the honour to 
subscribe myself, Sir,

Your obedient humble servant,
SILAS WEGG.


I suppose by this you will have seen the lad - and his feet 
will have been in the Monument - and his eyes beheld the face 
of George.  Well!

There is much eloquence in a well!
I am, Sir
Yours

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Arkansas.

This is an action upon the warrants of the county of Monroe, Arkansas, which were drawn by the clerk of the county upon its treasurer, in favor of one Frank Gallagher, and transferred by him to the plaintiff.

The following is a copy of one of them. The others are of like tenor and effect, though some of them are for only $20.

'$50.] [No. 804.

'The teasurer of the county of Monroe will pay to Frank Gallagher or bearer the sum of fifty dollars, out of any money in the treasury for general county purposes and not otherwise appropriated.

'Given under my hand, at office, in Clarendon, Ark., this fifteenth day of September, 1875.

'W. S. DUNLAP, ''Clerk''.'

They were renewal warrants, drawn in lieu of others which, under the laws of Arkansas, had been called in by the county court for examination, registration, and reissue. The called-in warrants, having been found to be just and legal claims against the county, were cancelled by order of the court, and the clerk was directed to issue new warrants in lieu thereof to the original payee, Frank Gallagher.

The new warrants were purchased in good faith for a valuable consideration by the plaintiff, who, on the refusal of the treasurer to pay them on demand, instituted this action. The answer sets up as a defence that said Gallagher was, at the time the warrants were issued to him, indebted to the county as surety on the official bond of one Ambrose Gallagher, tax-collector of the county, in a sum larger than the amount sued for; that since then the county has recovered a judgment against the said Frank Gallagher for a much larger amount than the warrants in suit; that the judgment was recovered before the transfer of the warrants to the plaintiff, and has not been reversed or modified, and is still in full force and unsatisfied; and it asks that the judgment may be set off against the warrants. The plaintiff demurred to the answer, alleging as the cause of demurrer that its allegations were not sufficient to constitute a defence at law.

Upon the argument of the demurrer the following questions arose:--

''First'', Is the defendant estopped by the reissue of the warrants to set up a defence known to have been existing at the time they were reissued in lieu of the original warrants surrendered to the county court, and by its order cancelled?

''Second'', Can the claim set up in the answer, if held by the county against the original payee when the warrants were issued or while they were still in his possession, be set up as defence of set-off in a suit by a holder of them for value, who had not notice of such defence when he acquired them?

On which questions the opinions of the judges were opposed, and the demurrer having been overruled, final judgment was rendered for the defendant.

Whereupon, upon motion of the plaintiff, the points on which the disagreement happened were stated under the direction of the judges, and certified to this court for final decision.

Under the law of Arkansas, the warrants which are the foundation of this suit are negotiable instruments. Rev. Stat., sects. 602, 603, 605; ''Crawford County'' v. ''Wilson'', 7 Ark. 214; ''Carnall'' v. ''Crawford County'', 11 id. 604; ''Gunn'' v. ''Pulaski County'', 3 id. 427; ''Adamson'' v. ''Adamson'', 9 id. 26; ''Brem'' v. ''Arkansas County Court'', id. 241; ''Reiff'' v. ''Conner'', 10 id. 241; ''Jefferson County'' v. ''Hudson'', 22 id. 595.

Sect. 27, art. 7, of the Constitution of the State gives to the county court exclusive original jurisdiction in the local concerns of the county. It is a court of record. Its judgment allowing demands against the county, and directing the issue of a warrant for their payment, merges them and all preexisting equities between the parties, and cannot be collaterally impeached.

The transferee of the warrants sued on must be treated as the assignee of the judgment pursuant to which they were issued. A defence which might have been made available against the original claim cannot be set up in an action on the judgment. ''Noble'' v. ''Merrill'', 48 Me. 140; ''Guinard'' v. ''Heysinger'', 15 Ill. 288; ''Flint'' v. ''Sheldon'', 13 Mass. 443; ''Ellis'' v. ''Clarke'', 19 Ark. 420.

The defence here does not arise out of the transaction in which the warrants, all of which bear date in 1875, were issued. It rests upon a claim of the county against the original payee, who was a surety of the defaulting county tax-collector for the year 1872. Conceding that they are of no higher grade than bills of exchange or promissory notes negotiated after maturity, the county could not avail itself of the defence set up.

The indorsee of an overdue negotiable note takes it subject to all the equities which attached to it in the hands of the payee, if they are connected with the note itself, but not to such as grow out of distinct and independent transactions. ''National Bank of Washington'' v. ''Texas'', 20 Wall. 72, 89; ''Oulds'' v. ''Harrison'', 10 Exch. Rep. 572; ''Burrough'' v. ''Moss'', 10 Barn. &amp; Cress. 558; ''Renwick'' v. ''Williams'', 2, Md. 356.

''Mr. M. T. Sanders'' for the plaintiff in error.

''Mr. Augustus H. Garland, contra''.

MR. JUSTICE FIELD delivered the opinion the court.
